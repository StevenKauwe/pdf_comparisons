  - Witnesses can attend grievance meetings if deemed relevant and necessary by both parties.
  - Time limits exclude weekends and holidays and can be extended by mutual written agreement.

  - **Step 3 - Arbitration:** If unresolved, the Union notifies the intention to arbitrate within 30 days. An arbitrator is selected from a panel of seven provided by the FMCS.
  - **Voluntary Mediation:** The Union can request mediation within 7 days of appealing to arbitration.
  - **Evidence Production:** Either party can request relevant evidence. Failure to produce requested evidence can result in it being inadmissible in arbitration.
  - **Limits on the Arbitrator:** The arbitrator cannot modify the agreement, and their decision should be issued within 30 days of receiving post-hearing briefs. Costs are shared equally, but each party bears its own representation expenses.

### Comparison with Mountain View and Southern Hills

#### Definition of Grievance

- **Sunrise:** Includes disputes over interpretation, application, compliance, and just cause for discipline.
- **Mountain View & Southern Hills:** Similar definition but explicitly mention a written complaint on an Appendix C form.

#### Time Limits, Representation, and Witnesses

- **Sunrise:** Specific time limits for each step, representation by Union Steward/Field Representative, and witness attendance if relevant.
- **Mountain View & Southern Hills:** Similar time limits but more detailed on the pre-grievance step requiring informal resolution with the immediate supervisor. Representation and witness attendance are also similar.

#### Grievance Procedure

| Step | Sunrise | Mountain View | Southern Hills |
|------|---------|---------------|----------------|
| Step 1 | 15 days to file, meeting within 10 days, response within 15 days | 14 days to file, meeting within 7 days, response within 7 days | 14 days to file, meeting within 7 days, response within 7 days |
| Step 2 | 15 days to request, meeting within 15 days, response within 15 days | 7 days to request, meeting within 7 days, response within 7 days | 7 days to request, meeting within 7 days, response within 7 days |
| Step 3 | 30 days to appeal to arbitration, arbitrator selected from FMCS panel | 7 days to appeal to arbitration, arbitrator selected from FMCS panel | 7 days to appeal to arbitration, arbitrator selected from FMCS panel |

#### Voluntary Mediation

- **Sunrise:** Union can request mediation within 7 days of appealing to arbitration.
- **Mountain View & Southern Hills:** Similar provision.

#### Evidence Production

- **Sunrise:** Either party can request relevant evidence, and failure to produce requested evidence can result in it being inadmissible.

#### Limits on the Arbitrator

- **Sunrise:** Arbitrator cannot modify the agreement, and decision should be issued within 30 days. Costs are shared equally.
- **Mountain View & Southern Hills:** Similar limits but more detailed on specific powers the arbitrator does not have, such as changing wage scales or deciding on employee classifications.

### Recommendations for Sunrise

1. **Pre-Grievance Step:** Consider adopting the pre-grievance step from Mountain View and Southern Hills, which requires employees to discuss concerns with their immediate supervisor before filing a written grievance. This promotes a problem-solving atmosphere and may resolve issues more informally.

2. **Time Limits:** The time limits in Mountain View and Southern Hills are slightly shorter (7 days for responses and meetings). Adopting these shorter time frames could expedite the grievance process.

3. **Arbitrator Limits:** The detailed limits on the arbitrator's powers in Mountain View and Southern Hills provide clearer boundaries. Sunrise should consider adopting similar language to ensure clarity on what the arbitrator can and cannot decide.

4. **Multi-Grievant Issues:** Both Mountain View and Southern Hills have specific provisions for handling grievances involving multiple grievants. Sunrise should consider adding similar language to streamline the process for such cases.

By incorporating these elements, Sunrise can enhance its grievance and arbitration process, making it more efficient and clear for all parties involved.---

### Differences and Recommendations

- **Language Consistency**: The language in the non-discrimination clause and grievance procedure is consistent across Sunrise, Mountain View, and Southern Hills.
- **Formatting**: The only minor difference is the formatting in the Southern Hills contract where "Article 10" is not followed by "above." This is a negligible difference and does not affect the substance of the agreement.

**Recommendation**: Since there are no substantive differences between the sections, Sunrise does not need to adopt any changes from Mountain View or Southern Hills. The current language in the Sunrise contract is already aligned with the other two contracts.---

1. **Jury Duty Payment Duration:**
   - **Mountain View** specifies a maximum of two (2) calendar weeks for jury duty payment.

# ARTICLE 24 WORK IN A HIGHER PAY GRADE
### Summary of Sunrise Section
**Article 24: Work in a Higher Pay Grade**
- Employees temporarily assigned to a higher pay grade for at least 36 hours in each of two consecutive work weeks will receive a 5% pay increase for all hours worked in the higher classification.
- Employees will continue to receive any applicable shift differential during the acting assignment if they work a shift eligible for such differential.

### Comparison with Mountain View and Southern Hills

| Aspect | Sunrise | Mountain View | Southern Hills |
|--------|---------|---------------|----------------|
| **Minimum Duration** | 36 hours in each of two consecutive work weeks | No minimum duration specified | A full pay period |
| **Pay Increase** | 5% above hourly rate | 5% above hourly rate | 5% above hourly rate |
| **Shift Differential** | Continues if eligible | Continues if eligible | Continues if eligible |

### Differences and Recommendations

1. **Minimum Duration Requirement:**
   - **Sunrise:** Requires at least 36 hours in each of two consecutive work weeks.
   - **Mountain View:** No minimum duration specified.
   - **Southern Hills:** Requires a full pay period.

   **Recommendation:** 
   - Adopting Mountain View's language could be advantageous as it does not specify a minimum duration, making it easier for employees to qualify for the higher pay rate. This could be more beneficial for employees who may not meet the 36-hour requirement but still perform higher-grade duties.

2. **Pay Increase:**
   - All three contracts specify a 5% pay increase above the hourly rate for all hours worked in the higher classification.

   **Recommendation:** 
   - No change needed; the 5% increase is consistent across all contracts.

3. **Shift Differential:**
   - All three contracts ensure that employees continue to receive any applicable shift differential during the acting assignment if they work a shift eligible for such differential.

   **Recommendation:** 
   - No change needed; the shift differential provision is consistent across all contracts.

### Conclusion
Sunrise should consider adopting the language from Mountain View regarding the minimum duration requirement for working in a higher pay grade. This would eliminate the need for a specific duration and potentially benefit more employees. The pay increase and shift differential provisions are already aligned and do not require changes.---

### Differences and Recommendations

1. **Rest and Meal Periods**:
   - **Mountain View**: Provides one 15-minute paid rest break for every four hours worked, which could be more flexible for employees working shorter shifts.
   - **Sunrise and Southern Hills**: Provide two 15-minute paid rest breaks for an 8-hour shift.

   **Recommendation**: Sunrise should consider adopting Mountain View's language for rest breaks to provide more flexibility for employees working shorter shifts.

2. **Other Sections**: No significant differences were found in other sections.

### Conclusion

The primary difference lies in the rest and meal periods. Adopting Mountain View's language for rest breaks could offer more flexibility for employees working shorter shifts. Other sections are consistent across all three contracts.---

   - **Mountain View** allows cash out in excess of 40 hours, whereas **Sunrise** and **Southern Hills** require 80 hours.

### Comparison with Mountain View and Southern Hills

| **Aspect**                  | **Sunrise**                                                                 | **Mountain View**                                                            | **Southern Hills**                                                           |

### Differences and Recommendations

1. **Notice Requirement**:
   - **Sunrise and Mountain View**: Require employees to report absences three (3) hours in advance.
   - **Southern Hills**: Requires employees to report absences four (4) hours in advance.
   - **Recommendation**: Sunrise should consider adopting the four (4) hour notice requirement from Southern Hills. This provides more time for the hospital to adjust staffing and ensure coverage.

2. **Doctor’s Note**:
   - All three contracts have similar language regarding the requirement for a physician’s certificate for absences of three (3) or more successive shifts or under certain conditions.
   - **Recommendation**: No changes needed; the current language in Sunrise is consistent with both Mountain View and Southern Hills.

3. **Fitness-for-Duty**:
   - All three contracts allow the hospital to require a fitness-for-duty certification and provide paid administrative leave pending the examination.
   - **Recommendation**: No changes needed; the current language in Sunrise is consistent with both Mountain View and Southern Hills.

### Conclusion

The primary difference lies in the notice requirement for reporting absences. Adopting the four (4) hour notice requirement from Southern Hills could be beneficial for Sunrise, providing more time for the hospital to manage staffing needs. Other aspects of the section are consistent across all three contracts and do not require changes.---

### Differences and Recommendations

1. **PTO Requirement:**
   - **Mountain View** does not mention the requirement for employees to take PTO for absences on holidays they would otherwise work.
   - **Recommendation:** Sunrise should consider whether the PTO requirement is beneficial for their employees. If not, they might want to adopt the Mountain View approach and remove this requirement.

Overall, the sections from Mountain View and Southern Hills are very similar to Sunrise, with the primary difference being the PTO requirement mentioned in Sunrise and Southern Hills but not in Mountain View.---

### Differences
1. **Hospital Name Mentioned:**
   - **Sunrise:** "Sunrise Hospital"
   - **Mountain View:** "the Hospital"
   - **Southern Hills:** "Southern Hills Hospital"

### Recommendation
The primary difference is the specific mention of the hospital name. This is a minor difference and does not affect the substance of the coverage. However, for consistency and clarity, it might be beneficial to adopt the language from Mountain View, which uses "the Hospital." This can make the contract more adaptable if there are any future changes in the hospital's name or ownership.

**Suggested Language for Sunrise:**
```markdown
The Hospital will continue to carry medical malpractice insurance coverage on all employees involved in patient care, which provides coverage for employees when they are acting in the course and scope of their employment (as defined in the policy of insurance) with the Hospital, from the first day of employment.
```

This change ensures that the contract remains relevant regardless of any potential changes to the hospital's name.---

|---------|---------|---------------|----------------|
| 48.1.1  | 5.25% increase effective July 1, 2023 | 5.25% increase effective after ratification | 5.25% increase effective after ratification |
| 48.1.2  | 4.5% increase effective July 1, 2024 | 4.5% increase effective July 1, 2024 | 4.5% increase effective July 1, 2024 |

### Minimum Rates

| Section | Sunrise | Mountain View | Southern Hills |
|---------|---------|---------------|----------------|
| 48.2    | Employer can increase wages, benefits, etc., but must notify and confer with the union | Same as Sunrise | Employer can adjust wages for all employees in a classification, must notify union 30 days in advance and explain reasons if requested |

**Differences:**
- **Southern Hills:** Specifies a 30-day advance notice and a meeting to explain reasons for wage adjustments.

**Recommendation:** Sunrise should consider adopting the 30-day advance notice and meeting clause from Southern Hills for better transparency and union involvement.

|---------|---------|---------------|----------------|
| 48.4    | Placed on appropriate step based on credited experience; "red circled" rate if avoiding layoff | Same as Sunrise | Pay reduced by 4% for each labor grade lower, but not less than minimum or greater than maximum rate for new grade |

**Differences:**
- **Southern Hills:** Specifies a 4% reduction for each lower labor grade, with limits.

**Recommendation:** Sunrise should consider adopting the specific reduction formula from Southern Hills for clarity and consistency in pay adjustments.

## Conclusion

Sunrise should consider the following changes to their contract based on the comparisons:

1. **Wage Scales:** Adopt the prompt implementation language from Mountain View and Southern Hills for the initial increase.
2. **Minimum Rates:** Include the 30-day advance notice and meeting clause from Southern Hills.
3. **Promotion to Higher Pay Grade:** Adopt the no reduction in pay clause from Southern Hills for non-RN promotions.
4. **Voluntary Transfer to Lower Pay Grade:** Adopt the specific reduction formula from Southern Hills for clarity.---

# ARTICLE 51 WORKLOAD
### Summary of Sunrise Section
**ARTICLE 51: WORKLOAD**
- The Hospital aims for equitable workload distribution during shifts.

## Comparison with Mountain View and Southern Hills

### Mountain View
- **No corresponding section found**

### Southern Hills
- **No corresponding section found**

## Recommendations for Sunrise

Since neither Mountain View nor Southern Hills have a corresponding section on extra shift differentials, Sunrise's current language stands out as a unique benefit. Here are some considerations:

1. **Maintain Current Language**: The extra shift differential provides a clear incentive for staff to work additional shifts, which can help with staffing shortages.
2. **Review Differential Rates**: Ensure that the differential rates are competitive within the industry. If possible, gather data on what other hospitals offer for similar extra shifts to ensure Sunrise remains attractive to staff.

Overall, Sunrise should maintain this section as it provides a structured and beneficial incentive for staff to take on extra shifts, which can help with staffing needs.---
# ARTICLE 53 PRECEPTOR PAY
### Summary of Sunrise Section
**Article 53: Preceptor Pay**
- The hospital will continue its existing Preceptor Pay Differential program.
- The rate for preceptor pay is $2.00 per hour.

### Comparison with Mountain View and Southern Hills

| Aspect                | Sunrise                                      | Mountain View                                | Southern Hills          |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Preceptor Pay Rate    | $2.00 per hour                               | $2.00 per hour                              | No corresponding section|
| Continuation of Program | Hospital will continue its existing program | Not explicitly mentioned                    | No corresponding section|

### Differences
- **Continuation of Program**: Sunrise explicitly states that the hospital will continue its existing Preceptor Pay Differential program, whereas Mountain View does not mention the continuation of an existing program.

### Recommendations for Sunrise
- **Adopt Mountain View's Language**: The language in Mountain View's contract is more straightforward and focuses solely on the preceptor pay rate without mentioning the continuation of an existing program. This could simplify the contract language.

### Suggested Language for Sunrise
```markdown
**Article 53: Preceptor Pay**
The Hospital shall pay a preceptor differential of $2.00 per hour to employees who are designated as a preceptor.
```

This language is clear and concise, ensuring that the preceptor pay rate is maintained without the need for additional context about the continuation of an existing program.---

### Comparison with Mountain View and Southern Hills

- **Mountain View**: No corresponding section found.

Since there are no corresponding sections in the Mountain View and Southern Hills contracts, Sunrise's current language in **ARTICLE 54** is unique and comprehensive. It ensures that the Union receives detailed and timely information about employees, which is beneficial for union operations. Additionally, the indemnification clause in **54.2** protects the Hospital from potential legal issues related to data sharing.

**Recommendation**: Maintain the current language in **ARTICLE 54** as it provides a clear and advantageous framework for both the Union and the Hospital.---
# ARTICLE 55 PAY CHECK ERRORS

### Comparison with Mountain View and Southern Hills

### Recommendations for Sunrise

Since neither Mountain View nor Southern Hills have a corresponding section on paycheck errors, Sunrise's current language in **ARTICLE 55** is unique and provides clear guidelines for correcting paycheck errors. This section is advantageous for employees as it ensures timely correction of both employer and employee errors.

**Recommendation**: Maintain the current language in **ARTICLE 55** as it provides clear and employee-friendly guidelines for handling paycheck errors.---

- **Double time pay** for hours worked beyond the scheduled shift in these circumstances.

## Comparison with Mountain View and Southern Hills

### Mountain View
- **No corresponding section found.**

### Southern Hills
- **No corresponding section found.**

## Recommendations for Sunrise

Since neither Mountain View nor Southern Hills have a corresponding section on mandatory overtime, Sunrise's current language stands out as comprehensive and protective of employee rights. The provisions for double time pay and the requirement to seek volunteers first are advantageous for employees.

### Conclusion
- **No changes needed**: Sunrise's current language on mandatory overtime is robust and beneficial for employees.---
# ARTICLE 57 FUNDS FOR EDUCATION AND TRAINING
### Summary of Sunrise Section

### Differences

There are no differences between the Sunrise, Mountain View, and Southern Hills sections regarding funds for education and training. All three contracts have identical language in this section.

### Recommendation

Since there are no differences, Sunrise does not need to adopt any changes from Mountain View or Southern Hills for this section. The current language in the Sunrise contract is already aligned with the other two contracts.---

## Comparison with Mountain View and Southern Hills

### Mountain View

## Recommendations for Sunrise

Since there are no corresponding sections in the Mountain View and Southern Hills contracts, the Sunrise contract's provisions on the relocation of bargaining unit work, bumping rights, severance benefits, and the use of agency and traveler employees remain unique. 

### Key Points to Retain:
- **Advance Notice**: The 30-day advance notice to the union is a good practice for transparency.
- **Bumping Rights**: The detailed bumping rights provide a clear process for employees whose jobs are eliminated.
- **Severance Benefits**: The structured severance benefits based on length of service are comprehensive and fair.
- **Effects Bargaining**: The commitment to bargain over other effects of relocation is beneficial for protecting employees' interests.

### No Changes Needed:
- Since there are no comparable sections in the other contracts, there are no additional advantageous terms to adopt from Mountain View or Southern Hills.

Sunrise should maintain its current language in Article 59 as it provides clear guidelines and protections for employees affected by the relocation of bargaining unit work.---

Both parties recognize the mutual advantage of having efficient and continuous operations of the Hospital to provide quality patient care. The article clarifies that it does not create any substantive rights, duties, or obligations for either party or provide evidence of intent regarding any substantive provision of the Agreement.

## Comparison with Mountain View and Southern Hills

### Mountain View

**ARTICLE 20: SHARED VISION**

The language in Mountain View's contract is identical to Sunrise's contract. Both sections emphasize the shared commitment to high-quality, therapeutic, accessible, and affordable healthcare, and the mutual efforts to provide the highest level of patient care. They also highlight the importance of respect, teamwork, and innovation. The final clause in both contracts states that the article does not create any substantive rights, duties, or obligations for either party.

### Southern Hills

**ARTICLE 20: SHARED VISION**

The language in Southern Hills' contract is almost identical to Sunrise's contract, with a few minor differences:

1. **Section Numbering**: Southern Hills includes section numbering (20.1 and 20.2), which is not present in Sunrise's contract.
2. **Wording**: The wording in Southern Hills' contract is slightly different in the final clause:
   - Southern Hills: "The statements set forth in Section 1 are not intended to create any substantive rights, duties, or obligations on the part of either party or to provide evidence of the intent of either party with respect to any substantive provision of this Agreement."
   - Sunrise: "Nothing contained in this Article is intended to create any substantive rights, duties, or obligations on the part of either party or to provide evidence of the intent of either party with respect to any substantive provision of this Agreement."

## Recommendations for Sunrise

- **Section Numbering**: Consider adopting the section numbering from Southern Hills (20.1 and 20.2) for better organization and clarity.
- **Wording**: The final clause in Southern Hills' contract is slightly more specific by referring to "Section 1." Sunrise could adopt this wording for added clarity.

### Recommendations for Sunrise

1. **Incorporate Unique Departments from Mountain View and Southern Hills:**
   - Consider adding departments like "Med/Surg" (Southern Hills), "Ortho/Neuro" (Southern Hills), and "Geri-Psych" (Southern Hills) if they are relevant to Sunrise's operations.
   - Evaluate the need for specialized units like "Red Rock MRI" and "Red Rock Mammography" from Mountain View.

2. **Standardize Naming Conventions:**
   - Ensure consistency in naming conventions across departments to avoid confusion. For example, "Nursing Float" in Sunrise is "Float Pool" in Mountain View.

3. **Review Overlapping Departments:**
   - For departments that exist in all three contracts, ensure that the scope and responsibilities are clearly defined and standardized.

By adopting the best practices and unique departments from Mountain View and Southern Hills, Sunrise can enhance its operational efficiency and ensure comprehensive coverage of all necessary services.---

### Differences and Recommendations

1. **Step 1 Submission:**
   - **Sunrise:** "Director of Labor Relations or his or her designee"
   - **Mountain View:** "Director of Human Resources or Administrative Assistant"
   - **Southern Hills:** "Director of Labor Relations or his or her designee or Administrative Assistant"

   **Recommendation:** Adopt the language from Southern Hills to include "Administrative Assistant" as an option for Step 1 Submission. This provides more flexibility in who can receive the grievance form.

   ```markdown
   Step 1 Submission (Director of Labor Relations or his or her designee or Administrative Assistant)
   ```

2. **No other significant differences** were found in the fields or structure of the grievance forms.

### Conclusion

The primary difference lies in the designation of the recipient for Step 1 Submission. Adopting the more flexible language from Southern Hills would be beneficial for Sunrise. Other than this, the grievance forms are quite similar across all three contracts.---

## Comparison with Mountain View and Southern Hills

**Mountain View:**
- No corresponding section found.

**Southern Hills:**
- No corresponding section found.

## Recommendations for Sunrise

Since there are no corresponding sections in the Mountain View and Southern Hills contracts, there are no differences to compare. Therefore, the current language in the Sunrise Float Pool Policy stands as is. 

However, it might be beneficial for Sunrise to consider the following:
- **Review and Update Regularly:** Ensure that the Float Pool Policy is reviewed and updated regularly to reflect any changes in staffing needs, competencies, and compensation practices.
- **Feedback Mechanism:** Implement a feedback mechanism for Float Pool staff to provide input on the policy's effectiveness and areas for improvement.
- **Benchmarking:** Although there are no corresponding sections in the other contracts, it might be useful to benchmark against similar institutions or industry standards to ensure competitiveness and fairness.

Overall, the current policy appears comprehensive and well-structured, addressing key areas such as eligibility, qualifications, management, and compensation.---
# APPENDIX G SIDE LETTER REGARDING SURGERY
### Summary of Sunrise Section

**APPENDIX G: SIDE LETTER REGARDING SURGERY**

- **Rest Period**: Employees in Surgical Services who have worked 16 hours within a 24-hour period should be given at least 10 hours of rest before their next shift.
- **PTO Usage**: Employees can choose to use Paid Time Off (PTO) for the rest period if they are excused from the succeeding shift.
- **Operational Issues**: If there are any operational or implementation problems with this language, the parties will meet to resolve these issues.

### Comparison with Mountain View and Southern Hills

- **Mountain View**: No corresponding section found.
- **Southern Hills**: No corresponding section found.

### Recommendations for Sunrise

Since there are no corresponding sections in the Mountain View and Southern Hills contracts, Sunrise's current language stands alone. Here are some considerations:

1. **Rest Period**: The provision for a 10-hour rest period after a 16-hour shift is beneficial for employee well-being and safety. This should be maintained.
2. **PTO Usage**: Allowing employees to use PTO for the rest period is a flexible option that can be advantageous for employees.
3. **Operational Issues**: The clause to meet and resolve operational issues is a good practice for maintaining open communication and problem-solving.

**Conclusion**: The language in Sunrise's contract is already advantageous for employees in Surgical Services. There is no need to adopt language from Mountain View or Southern Hills as they do not have corresponding sections.---

- **Formatting and Minor Textual Differences:** There are minor formatting differences, such as the use of "two (2)" in Southern Hills versus "two" in Sunrise and Mountain View. These do not affect the policy's substance.

### Recommendation for Sunrise

Since the content and policies are essentially identical across Sunrise, Mountain View, and Southern Hills, there is no need for Sunrise to adopt any changes from the other contracts. The current language in the Sunrise contract is already aligned with the best practices observed in the other contracts.---
# APPENDIX I SIDE LETTER RE MARKET ADJUSTMENTS
