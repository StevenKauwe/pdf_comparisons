### Differences and Recommendations

1. **Notification Period**:
   - **Sunrise**: 90 days for sale/merger, 45 days for non-temporary operational changes.
   - **Mountain View and Southern Hills**: 30 days for sale, transfer, assignment, or closure.
   - **Recommendation**: Sunrise's longer notification period (90 days) is more advantageous as it provides the union with more time to prepare and respond to changes. Sunrise should retain its current language.

2. **Good Faith Bargaining**:
   - All three contracts require good faith bargaining upon request.
   - **Recommendation**: No change needed; Sunrise's language is already aligned with best practices.

3. **Successor Obligations**:
   - **Sunrise**: Detailed obligations for the successor, including retaining employees and recognizing the union.
   - **Mountain View and Southern Hills**: Do not explicitly mention successor obligations.
   - **Recommendation**: Sunrise's detailed successor obligations are more protective of employees' rights. Sunrise should retain its current language.

4. **Memorandum of Understanding**:
   - **Sunrise**: Requires the acquiring entity to assume existing MOUs, with exceptions for HCA-specific benefit plans.
   - **Mountain View and Southern Hills**: Do not explicitly mention MOUs.
   - **Recommendation**: Sunrise's requirement for the successor to assume MOUs is beneficial for maintaining continuity. Sunrise should retain its current language.

### Conclusion

Sunrise's current language in Article 45 is more comprehensive and protective of employees' rights compared to Mountain View and Southern Hills. Therefore, Sunrise should retain its existing language in this section.
