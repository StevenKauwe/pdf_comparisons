## Recommendations for Sunrise

Since neither Mountain View nor Southern Hills have a corresponding section on extra shift differentials, Sunrise's current language stands out as a unique benefit. Here are some considerations:

1. **Maintain Current Language**: The extra shift differential provides a clear incentive for staff to work additional shifts, which can help with staffing shortages.
2. **Review Differential Rates**: Ensure that the differential rates are competitive within the industry. If possible, gather data on what other hospitals offer for similar extra shifts to ensure Sunrise remains attractive to staff.

Overall, Sunrise should maintain this section as it provides a structured and beneficial incentive for staff to take on extra shifts, which can help with staffing needs.
