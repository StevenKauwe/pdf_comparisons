## Recommendations for Sunrise

Since there are no corresponding sections in the Mountain View and Southern Hills contracts, there are no differences to compare. Therefore, the current language in the Sunrise Float Pool Policy stands as is. 

However, it might be beneficial for Sunrise to consider the following:
- **Review and Update Regularly:** Ensure that the Float Pool Policy is reviewed and updated regularly to reflect any changes in staffing needs, competencies, and compensation practices.
- **Feedback Mechanism:** Implement a feedback mechanism for Float Pool staff to provide input on the policy's effectiveness and areas for improvement.
- **Benchmarking:** Although there are no corresponding sections in the other contracts, it might be useful to benchmark against similar institutions or industry standards to ensure competitiveness and fairness.

Overall, the current policy appears comprehensive and well-structured, addressing key areas such as eligibility, qualifications, management, and compensation.
