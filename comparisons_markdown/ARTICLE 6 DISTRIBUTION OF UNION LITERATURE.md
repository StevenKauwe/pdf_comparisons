### Differences and Recommendations

1. **6.1.1.1 (Sunrise) vs. 6.1.2 (Mountain View and Southern Hills)**:
   - **Sunrise**: Excludes main entrances.
   - **Mountain View and Southern Hills**: No specific exclusion of main entrances, just "designated employee entrances."

   **Recommendation**: Consider adopting the Mountain View and Southern Hills language for broader distribution opportunities, unless there is a specific reason to exclude main entrances.

2. **6.1.2 (Sunrise) vs. Mountain View and Southern Hills**:
   - **Sunrise**: Literature must be delivered to the Director of Labor Relations.
   - **Mountain View**: Same as Sunrise but references Article 52.
   - **Southern Hills**: Literature must be delivered to the Human Resources Office or Nursing Supervisor if HR is closed, and references Article 52.

   **Recommendation**: Adopt the Southern Hills language for flexibility in delivering literature to the Nursing Supervisor if HR is closed. Also, ensure the correct article reference (Article 52) is used for consistency.

Sunrise should consider adopting the broader distribution language from Mountain View and Southern Hills regarding designated entrances and the flexible delivery options from Southern Hills. This would provide more opportunities for literature distribution and ensure consistency in article references.
