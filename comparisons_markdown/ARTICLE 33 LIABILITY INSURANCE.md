### Differences
1. **Hospital Name Mentioned:**
   - **Sunrise:** "Sunrise Hospital"
   - **Mountain View:** "the Hospital"
   - **Southern Hills:** "Southern Hills Hospital"

### Recommendation
The primary difference is the specific mention of the hospital name. This is a minor difference and does not affect the substance of the coverage. However, for consistency and clarity, it might be beneficial to adopt the language from Mountain View, which uses "the Hospital." This can make the contract more adaptable if there are any future changes in the hospital's name or ownership.

**Suggested Language for Sunrise:**
```markdown
The Hospital will continue to carry medical malpractice insurance coverage on all employees involved in patient care, which provides coverage for employees when they are acting in the course and scope of their employment (as defined in the policy of insurance) with the Hospital, from the first day of employment.
```

This change ensures that the contract remains relevant regardless of any potential changes to the hospital's name.
