## Comparison with Mountain View and Southern Hills

### Mountain View

**ARTICLE 20: SHARED VISION**

The language in Mountain View's contract is identical to Sunrise's contract. Both sections emphasize the shared commitment to high-quality, therapeutic, accessible, and affordable healthcare, and the mutual efforts to provide the highest level of patient care. They also highlight the importance of respect, teamwork, and innovation. The final clause in both contracts states that the article does not create any substantive rights, duties, or obligations for either party.

### Southern Hills

**ARTICLE 20: SHARED VISION**

The language in Southern Hills' contract is almost identical to Sunrise's contract, with a few minor differences:

1. **Section Numbering**: Southern Hills includes section numbering (20.1 and 20.2), which is not present in Sunrise's contract.
2. **Wording**: The wording in Southern Hills' contract is slightly different in the final clause:
   - Southern Hills: "The statements set forth in Section 1 are not intended to create any substantive rights, duties, or obligations on the part of either party or to provide evidence of the intent of either party with respect to any substantive provision of this Agreement."
   - Sunrise: "Nothing contained in this Article is intended to create any substantive rights, duties, or obligations on the part of either party or to provide evidence of the intent of either party with respect to any substantive provision of this Agreement."

## Recommendations for Sunrise

- **Section Numbering**: Consider adopting the section numbering from Southern Hills (20.1 and 20.2) for better organization and clarity.
- **Wording**: The final clause in Southern Hills' contract is slightly more specific by referring to "Section 1." Sunrise could adopt this wording for added clarity.
