### Recommendations for Sunrise

Since there are no corresponding sections in the Mountain View and Southern Hills contracts, Sunrise's current language in Article 20 stands as unique and advantageous. The provisions for 1.5 times compensation for off-campus transport duties and the inclusion of these hours in overtime calculations are beneficial for employees. Therefore, no changes are recommended based on the comparison.
