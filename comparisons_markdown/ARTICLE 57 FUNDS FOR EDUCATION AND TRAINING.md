### Differences

There are no differences between the Sunrise, Mountain View, and Southern Hills sections regarding funds for education and training. All three contracts have identical language in this section.

### Recommendation

Since there are no differences, Sunrise does not need to adopt any changes from Mountain View or Southern Hills for this section. The current language in the Sunrise contract is already aligned with the other two contracts.
