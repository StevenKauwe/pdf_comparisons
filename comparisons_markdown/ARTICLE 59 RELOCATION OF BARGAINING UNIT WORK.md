## Summary of Sunrise Section

**ARTICLE 59: RELOCATION OF BARGAINING UNIT WORK**

### 59.1 Right of Hospital to Relocate Bargaining Unit Work
- The hospital can relocate work to another HCA affiliate as part of a corporate program.
- Functions formerly performed by relocated employees will not be performed within the hospital except by bargaining unit employees.
- The hospital must notify the union at least 30 days in advance of the relocation.

### 59.2 Effects of the Relocation
- **Bumping Rights**: 
  - Full-time or part-time employees whose jobs are eliminated can bump the least senior employee in their department/cost center or classification on the same shift, provided they can perform the job with no more than 10 days of orientation.
  - Only one level of bumping is allowed.
  - Employees may be required to bid on vacant positions before bumping.
- **Severance Benefits**:
  - Severance pay is based on length of service, ranging from 2 weeks (80 hours) for employees with at least 91 days but less than 3 years of service, to 12 weeks (480 hours) for employees with 20 years or more of service.
  - Severance pay is bi-weekly, and insurance coverage continues during the severance period.
  - Severance entitlement ceases upon return to work or 14 days from the mailing of a written communication of available employment.
  - Severance does not apply if the employee declines an offer of continued employment at a base salary level of at least 85% of their most recent base salary.
  - Prorated severance is available if the new job's salary is more than 15% below the most recent base salary.
  - Consideration is given to commuting distance for job offers.
  - Employees rehired within 90 days retain a pro-rated portion of severance.
- **Effects Bargaining**: The hospital will bargain with the union over other effects of the relocation on employees.

### 59.3 Use of Agency and Traveler Employees
- The article does not prohibit the use of agency or traveler employees from an HCA affiliate to supplement staffing.

## Comparison with Mountain View and Southern Hills

### Mountain View
- **No corresponding section found.**

### Southern Hills
- **No corresponding section found.**

## Recommendations for Sunrise

Since there are no corresponding sections in the Mountain View and Southern Hills contracts, the Sunrise contract's provisions on the relocation of bargaining unit work, bumping rights, severance benefits, and the use of agency and traveler employees remain unique. 

### Key Points to Retain:
- **Advance Notice**: The 30-day advance notice to the union is a good practice for transparency.
- **Bumping Rights**: The detailed bumping rights provide a clear process for employees whose jobs are eliminated.
- **Severance Benefits**: The structured severance benefits based on length of service are comprehensive and fair.
- **Effects Bargaining**: The commitment to bargain over other effects of relocation is beneficial for protecting employees' interests.

### No Changes Needed:
- Since there are no comparable sections in the other contracts, there are no additional advantageous terms to adopt from Mountain View or Southern Hills.

Sunrise should maintain its current language in Article 59 as it provides clear guidelines and protections for employees affected by the relocation of bargaining unit work.
