### Analysis

There are no differences between the Sunrise, Mountain View, and Southern Hills sections regarding time off to vote. All three contracts have identical language and provisions.

### Recommendation

Since there are no differences, Sunrise does not need to adopt any changes from Mountain View or Southern Hills for this section. The current language in the Sunrise contract is already aligned with the other two contracts.
