### Summary of Sunrise Section
**Article 24: Work in a Higher Pay Grade**
- Employees temporarily assigned to a higher pay grade for at least 36 hours in each of two consecutive work weeks will receive a 5% pay increase for all hours worked in the higher classification.
- Employees will continue to receive any applicable shift differential during the acting assignment if they work a shift eligible for such differential.

### Comparison with Mountain View and Southern Hills

| Aspect | Sunrise | Mountain View | Southern Hills |
|--------|---------|---------------|----------------|
| **Minimum Duration** | 36 hours in each of two consecutive work weeks | No minimum duration specified | A full pay period |
| **Pay Increase** | 5% above hourly rate | 5% above hourly rate | 5% above hourly rate |
| **Shift Differential** | Continues if eligible | Continues if eligible | Continues if eligible |

### Differences and Recommendations

1. **Minimum Duration Requirement:**
   - **Sunrise:** Requires at least 36 hours in each of two consecutive work weeks.
   - **Mountain View:** No minimum duration specified.
   - **Southern Hills:** Requires a full pay period.

   **Recommendation:** 
   - Adopting Mountain View's language could be advantageous as it does not specify a minimum duration, making it easier for employees to qualify for the higher pay rate. This could be more beneficial for employees who may not meet the 36-hour requirement but still perform higher-grade duties.

2. **Pay Increase:**
   - All three contracts specify a 5% pay increase above the hourly rate for all hours worked in the higher classification.

   **Recommendation:** 
   - No change needed; the 5% increase is consistent across all contracts.

3. **Shift Differential:**
   - All three contracts ensure that employees continue to receive any applicable shift differential during the acting assignment if they work a shift eligible for such differential.

   **Recommendation:** 
   - No change needed; the shift differential provision is consistent across all contracts.

### Conclusion
Sunrise should consider adopting the language from Mountain View regarding the minimum duration requirement for working in a higher pay grade. This would eliminate the need for a specific duration and potentially benefit more employees. The pay increase and shift differential provisions are already aligned and do not require changes.
