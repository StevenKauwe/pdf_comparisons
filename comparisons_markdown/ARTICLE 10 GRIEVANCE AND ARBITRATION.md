### Summary of Sunrise Section

**Article 10: Grievance and Arbitration**

- **10.1 Definition of Grievance that is Subject to Arbitration:** 
  - A grievance subject to arbitration involves disputes over the interpretation, application, or compliance with the agreement, or disputes over whether discipline, including discharge, was for just cause.
  - The Union can file a grievance on behalf of one or more bargaining unit members.

- **10.2 Time Limits, Representation, and Witnesses:**
  - Grievances must be presented within specified time limits at each step.
  - Failure to adhere to time limits renders the grievance null and void, but management's failure to respond timely allows the grievance to proceed to the next step.
  - Employees can be represented by a Union Steward and/or Field Representative.
  - Witnesses can attend grievance meetings if deemed relevant and necessary by both parties.
  - Time limits exclude weekends and holidays and can be extended by mutual written agreement.

- **10.3 Grievance Procedure:**
  - **Step 1:** Grievance filed in writing within 15 days of the event or knowledge of the event. A meeting is held within 10 days, and a written response is provided within 15 days.
  - **Step 2:** If unresolved, the Union requests in writing to move to Step 2 within 15 days. A meeting is held within 15 days, and a written response is provided within 15 days.
  - **Step 3 - Arbitration:** If unresolved, the Union notifies the intention to arbitrate within 30 days. An arbitrator is selected from a panel of seven provided by the FMCS.
  - **Voluntary Mediation:** The Union can request mediation within 7 days of appealing to arbitration.
  - **Evidence Production:** Either party can request relevant evidence. Failure to produce requested evidence can result in it being inadmissible in arbitration.
  - **Limits on the Arbitrator:** The arbitrator cannot modify the agreement, and their decision should be issued within 30 days of receiving post-hearing briefs. Costs are shared equally, but each party bears its own representation expenses.

### Recommendations for Sunrise

1. **Pre-Grievance Step:** Consider adopting the pre-grievance step from Mountain View and Southern Hills, which requires employees to discuss concerns with their immediate supervisor before filing a written grievance. This promotes a problem-solving atmosphere and may resolve issues more informally.

2. **Time Limits:** The time limits in Mountain View and Southern Hills are slightly shorter (7 days for responses and meetings). Adopting these shorter time frames could expedite the grievance process.

3. **Arbitrator Limits:** The detailed limits on the arbitrator's powers in Mountain View and Southern Hills provide clearer boundaries. Sunrise should consider adopting similar language to ensure clarity on what the arbitrator can and cannot decide.

4. **Multi-Grievant Issues:** Both Mountain View and Southern Hills have specific provisions for handling grievances involving multiple grievants. Sunrise should consider adding similar language to streamline the process for such cases.

By incorporating these elements, Sunrise can enhance its grievance and arbitration process, making it more efficient and clear for all parties involved.
