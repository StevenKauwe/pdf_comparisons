### Summary of Sunrise Section

**ARTICLE 30: ABSENCE FROM WORK**

1. **Notice Requirement**: Employees must report any absence from their scheduled shift to their manager (or designated supervisor) three (3) hours in advance, unless an emergency makes it impossible.
2. **Doctor’s Note**: For absences due to personal illness or injury lasting three (3) or more successive shifts, the Hospital may require a physician’s certificate. This certificate may also be required for a single day of absence under certain conditions. Employees have seven (7) days to provide the certificate if requested.
3. **Fitness-for-Duty**: The Hospital can require a fitness-for-duty certification from a physician if there are questions about the employee's fitness to return to work. Employees removed from scheduled shifts pending this examination will be placed on paid administrative leave, except in cases of delay caused by the employee or if the examination concludes the employee is not fit for duty.

   - **Sunrise and Mountain View**: Require employees to report absences three (3) hours in advance.
   - **Southern Hills**: Requires employees to report absences four (4) hours in advance.
   - **Recommendation**: Sunrise should consider adopting the four (4) hour notice requirement from Southern Hills. This provides more time for the hospital to adjust staffing and ensure coverage.

2. **Doctor’s Note**:
   - All three contracts have similar language regarding the requirement for a physician’s certificate for absences of three (3) or more successive shifts or under certain conditions.
   - **Recommendation**: No changes needed; the current language in Sunrise is consistent with both Mountain View and Southern Hills.

3. **Fitness-for-Duty**:
   - All three contracts allow the hospital to require a fitness-for-duty certification and provide paid administrative leave pending the examination.
   - **Recommendation**: No changes needed; the current language in Sunrise is consistent with both Mountain View and Southern Hills.

### Conclusion

The primary difference lies in the notice requirement for reporting absences. Adopting the four (4) hour notice requirement from Southern Hills could be beneficial for Sunrise, providing more time for the hospital to manage staffing needs. Other aspects of the section are consistent across all three contracts and do not require changes.
