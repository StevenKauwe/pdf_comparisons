### Comparison with Mountain View and Southern Hills

- **Mountain View**: No corresponding section found.
- **Southern Hills**: No corresponding section found.

### Recommendations for Sunrise

Since there are no corresponding sections in the Mountain View and Southern Hills contracts, Sunrise's current language stands alone. Here are some considerations:

1. **Rest Period**: The provision for a 10-hour rest period after a 16-hour shift is beneficial for employee well-being and safety. This should be maintained.
2. **PTO Usage**: Allowing employees to use PTO for the rest period is a flexible option that can be advantageous for employees.
3. **Operational Issues**: The clause to meet and resolve operational issues is a good practice for maintaining open communication and problem-solving.

**Conclusion**: The language in Sunrise's contract is already advantageous for employees in Surgical Services. There is no need to adopt language from Mountain View or Southern Hills as they do not have corresponding sections.
