### Comparison with Mountain View and Southern Hills

| Aspect                | Sunrise                                      | Mountain View                                | Southern Hills          |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Preceptor Pay Rate    | $2.00 per hour                               | $2.00 per hour                              | No corresponding section|
| Continuation of Program | Hospital will continue its existing program | Not explicitly mentioned                    | No corresponding section|

### Differences
- **Continuation of Program**: Sunrise explicitly states that the hospital will continue its existing Preceptor Pay Differential program, whereas Mountain View does not mention the continuation of an existing program.

### Recommendations for Sunrise
- **Adopt Mountain View's Language**: The language in Mountain View's contract is more straightforward and focuses solely on the preceptor pay rate without mentioning the continuation of an existing program. This could simplify the contract language.

### Suggested Language for Sunrise
```markdown
**Article 53: Preceptor Pay**
The Hospital shall pay a preceptor differential of $2.00 per hour to employees who are designated as a preceptor.
```

This language is clear and concise, ensuring that the preceptor pay rate is maintained without the need for additional context about the continuation of an existing program.
