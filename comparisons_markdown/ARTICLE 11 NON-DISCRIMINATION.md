### Differences and Recommendations

- **Language Consistency**: The language in the non-discrimination clause and grievance procedure is consistent across Sunrise, Mountain View, and Southern Hills.
- **Formatting**: The only minor difference is the formatting in the Southern Hills contract where "Article 10" is not followed by "above." This is a negligible difference and does not affect the substance of the agreement.

**Recommendation**: Since there are no substantive differences between the sections, Sunrise does not need to adopt any changes from Mountain View or Southern Hills. The current language in the Sunrise contract is already aligned with the other two contracts.
