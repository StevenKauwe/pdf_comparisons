### Recommendations for Sunrise

1. **Incorporate Unique Departments from Mountain View and Southern Hills:**
   - Consider adding departments like "Med/Surg" (Southern Hills), "Ortho/Neuro" (Southern Hills), and "Geri-Psych" (Southern Hills) if they are relevant to Sunrise's operations.
   - Evaluate the need for specialized units like "Red Rock MRI" and "Red Rock Mammography" from Mountain View.

2. **Standardize Naming Conventions:**
   - Ensure consistency in naming conventions across departments to avoid confusion. For example, "Nursing Float" in Sunrise is "Float Pool" in Mountain View.

3. **Review Overlapping Departments:**
   - For departments that exist in all three contracts, ensure that the scope and responsibilities are clearly defined and standardized.

By adopting the best practices and unique departments from Mountain View and Southern Hills, Sunrise can enhance its operational efficiency and ensure comprehensive coverage of all necessary services.
