### Differences and Recommendations

1. **PTO Requirement:**
   - **Mountain View** does not mention the requirement for employees to take PTO for absences on holidays they would otherwise work.
   - **Recommendation:** Sunrise should consider whether the PTO requirement is beneficial for their employees. If not, they might want to adopt the Mountain View approach and remove this requirement.

Overall, the sections from Mountain View and Southern Hills are very similar to Sunrise, with the primary difference being the PTO requirement mentioned in Sunrise and Southern Hills but not in Mountain View.
