### Summary of Sunrise Section

**ARTICLE 12: PERSONNEL FILES**

- **Inspection Rights**: Employees can inspect electronic copies of their personnel files (excluding references from former employers) via the Hospital’s web portal, HR Answers, and make their own copies at no charge using the computer in Human Resources.
- **Copy Charges**: Copies of documents in personnel files (excluding reference responses from former employers) are provided upon written request at a charge of $0.60 per page. This does not apply to subpoenaed documents.

However, in cases of discharge due to patient abuse, violent conduct, or criminal conduct, the Hospital may provide truthful information about the reasons for discharge.
