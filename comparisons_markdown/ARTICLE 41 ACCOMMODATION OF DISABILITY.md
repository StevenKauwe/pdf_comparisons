### Differences

There are no differences between the Sunrise, Mountain View, and Southern Hills sections. All three sections are identical in language and stipulations.

### Recommendation

Since there are no differences, Sunrise does not need to adopt any language from Mountain View or Southern Hills. The current language in the Sunrise contract is already aligned with the other two contracts.
