### Summary of Sunrise Section

**ARTICLE 26: HOURS OF WORK AND OVERTIME**

1. **Work Week**: Defined as seven consecutive days. No guarantee of hours per day or week.
2. **No Pyramiding**: No pyramiding of overtime pay. Hours qualifying for at least time and one-half will not count towards other premium or overtime pay.
3. **Hours Worked**: Only hours actually worked count for overtime. Employees working over 16 hours get 8 hours off before returning. PTO can be used for this time off. Employees must verify their hours worked.
4. **Overtime Premiums**: Overtime paid as per current practices. Mandatory meetings/training outside regular shifts are paid at the applicable rate and count towards overtime. Overtime is rotated equitably if volunteers are insufficient. Extra shifts/hours may lead to voluntary reductions or call-offs.
5. **Rest and Meal Periods**: One 30-minute unpaid meal period and two 15-minute paid rest breaks per 8-hour shift. Breaks at reasonable intervals, but not always possible. Employees can't leave premises during rest breaks but can during lunch with permission. Combining breaks requires supervisor's permission. Additional rest break for extra 4 hours worked. Some employees may need to clock in/out for lunch.
6. **Reporting Pay**: Guaranteed two hours of work or pay if reporting without prior notice of no work.
7. **Travel Pay**: Paid for reasonable travel time if directed to another location during the same shift.

### Differences and Recommendations

1. **Rest and Meal Periods**:
   - **Mountain View**: Provides one 15-minute paid rest break for every four hours worked, which could be more flexible for employees working shorter shifts.
   - **Sunrise and Southern Hills**: Provide two 15-minute paid rest breaks for an 8-hour shift.

   **Recommendation**: Sunrise should consider adopting Mountain View's language for rest breaks to provide more flexibility for employees working shorter shifts.

2. **Other Sections**: No significant differences were found in other sections.

### Conclusion

The primary difference lies in the rest and meal periods. Adopting Mountain View's language for rest breaks could offer more flexibility for employees working shorter shifts. Other sections are consistent across all three contracts.
