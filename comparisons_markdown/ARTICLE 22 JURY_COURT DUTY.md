   - **Mountain View** specifies a maximum of two (2) calendar weeks for jury duty payment.
   - **Sunrise** and **Southern Hills** do not specify a duration limit.

By adopting the two-week limit for jury duty payment from Mountain View, Sunrise can ensure a clear and manageable policy while maintaining consistency with other provisions.
