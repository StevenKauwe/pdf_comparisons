ARTICLE 12 

PERSONNEL FILES 
Each employee shall have the right to inspect electronic copies of his/her personnel file 
(not including references received from former employers) through the Hospital’s web portal, 
HR Answers and to make their own copies, at no charge, using the computer in Human 
Resources.  Copies of documents in personnel files (other than reference responses from former 
employers) will be provided upon written request of the employee at the charge of $.60 per page.  
This provision has no application to what the Hospital charges for copies of documents requested 
in subpoenas.  Union representatives shall be allowed to inspect such records in connection with 
a potential or pending grievance, if authorized in writing by the grievant.  All such inspections 
will be conducted in the presence of the Director of Labor Relations or his or her designee at a 
location selected by the Hospital during normal office hours. 
If an employee disputes the accuracy of materials placed in the employee’s file, the 
employee shall have the option of responding to the disputed materials and the response will be 
attached to the materials. The response will be of a reasonable length. If the employee can show 
the Human Resources Office that materials in the file are erroneous and the manager does not 
dispute the employee’s claim, the Human Resources Office will expunge the material from the 
employee’s file. 
The Hospital shall not release information in employees’ personnel files beyond dates of 
employment and job titles unless authorized by the employee or required by law; provided, if an 
employee is discharged because of patient abuse, violent conduct, or criminal conduct, the 
Hospital may, in its discretion, provide truthful information concerning the reasons for discharge.
