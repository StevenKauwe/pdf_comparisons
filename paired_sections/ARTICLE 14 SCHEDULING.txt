ARTICLE 14 

SCHEDULING 
14.1 
In General. 
Schedules shall be made out according to the needs of the department or unit.  The 
Hospital agrees to continue the practice of permitting full-time and part-time employees, in 
departments which do not have fixed or rotating schedules, to submit timely written requests to 
his/her department manager (or designee) indicating their preference for days off.  Conflicting 
requests for a given day off on file in the department or unit at the time the schedule is being 
prepared will be resolved by granting the requests on a rotating basis, beginning with the most 
senior of the requesters, provided, in the good faith judgment of the Hospital, such selection will 
not adversely affect patient care or productivity and will not unfairly burden other staff with 
unreasonable schedules.  The Hospital will also continue the practice of permitting employees to 
exchange shifts, where such exchanges do not result in additional overtime or premium pay, and 
when, in the good faith judgment of the department manager (or designee), the request can be 
accommodated without adversely affecting patient care.  VSP employees who are scheduled for 
work hours may exchange shifts with other employees as described above. 
In the event it becomes necessary to revise the schedules of staff in a department in which 
the staff have fixed or rotating schedules, the manager will communicate with employees prior to 
implementation of such proposed changes to make a reasonable attempt to revise the schedule so 
as to have the least impact on the fewest full-time and part-time staff.  Once the new schedule is 
established, and if the employees request, the department will post bids for the new schedules 
and bidding will be accomplished by classification seniority. 
14.2 
Weekends. 
The parties recognize that, in units which do not have fixed or rotating schedules, full-
time employees and “travelers” are expected to share equitably the weekend shifts.  Part-time 
employees in such units will be required to work at least two (2) weekend day or three (3) 
weekend night shifts per four (4) week schedule and VSP employees shall work at least one (1) 
weekend shift per four (4) week schedule, if needed (as specified in Article 7, Status of 
Employment).  Except for employees who are hired into, or who bid into, a position calling for a 
more frequent weekend schedule, the Hospital will make every reasonable effort not to require 
full-time day shift employees to work more than four (4), or full-time night shift employees work 
more than six (6), weekend shifts in any given four (4) week schedule. 
14.3 
Posting of Schedules. 
Schedules for all employees, covering a period of at least four (4) weeks, will normally 
be posted at least thirteen (13) days in advance of the beginning of the schedule, unless a 
shortage of staff precludes that amount of notice (in which case such schedules will be posted 
with as much advance notice as possible).  VSP employees will not normally be scheduled for 
work hours until all full-time and part-time staff is scheduled for their hours of work.  Travelers 
and agency staff will not be scheduled for work hours until all full-time and part-time employees 
 
18 
are scheduled for their regular hours. 
14.4 
Changes to Posted Schedules. 
Any scheduled change to a posted schedule with less than seven (7) days’ notice will 
require notification and approval of the employee except in case of declared emergencies by the 
Governor or Federal Government. 
14.5 
Applicability of Article. 
This Article does not apply to daily reductions in staffing addressed in the Call-Off 
Procedure (Article 18), nor does it apply to extension of hours beyond the scheduled end of a 
shift due to operational needs.

SCHEDULING 
Section 1. 
In General 
(a) 
Schedules shall be made out according to the needs of the department or unit.  
The Hospital agrees to continue the practice of permitting full-time and part-time employees, in 
departments which do not have fixed or rotating schedules, to submit timely written requests to 
his/her department manager (or designee) indicating their preference for days off.  Conflicting 
requests for a given day off on file in the department or unit at the time the schedule is being 
prepared will be resolved by granting the requests on a rotating basis, beginning with the 
employees who have been in the unit the longest, provided, in the good faith judgment of the 
 
18 

Hospital, such selection will not adversely affect patient care or productivity and will not 
unfairly burden other staff with unreasonable schedules.  The Hospital will also continue the 
practice of permitting employees to exchange shifts, where such exchanges do not result in 
additional overtime or premium pay, and when, in the good faith judgment of the department 
manager (or designee), the request can be accommodated without adversely affecting patient 
care.  VSP employees who are scheduled for work hours may exchange shifts with other 
employees as described above. 
(b) 
In the event it becomes necessary to revise the schedules of staff in a department 
in which the staff have fixed or rotating schedules, the manager will communicate with 
employees prior to implementation of such proposed changes to make a reasonable attempt to 
revise the schedule so as to have the least impact on the fewest full-time and part-time staff.  
Once the new schedule is established, and if the employees request, the department will post bids 
for the new schedules and bidding will be accomplished by seniority within each classification. 
Section 2. 
Weekends 
The parties recognize that, in units which do not have fixed or rotating schedules, full-time 
employees and “travelers” are expected to share equitably the weekend shifts.  Part-time 
employees in such units will be required to work at least two (2) weekend days or three (3) 
weekend night shifts per four (4) week schedule and VSP employees shall work at least one (1) 
weekend shift per four (4) week schedule, if needed (as specified in Article 7).  The Hospital will 
make every reasonable effort not to require employees to work more than fifty-two (52) weekend 
shifts per year, except for employees specifically hired to work a more frequent weekend 
schedule.  The minimums in this Section do not apply to employees hired to fill a specific night 
or weekend need. 
Section 3. 
Posting of Schedules 
Schedules for all employees, covering a period of at least four (4) weeks, will normally be posted 
at least thirteen (13) days in advance of the beginning of the schedule, unless a shortage of staff 
precludes that amount of notice (in which case such schedules will be posted with as much 
advance notice as possible).  VSP employees will not normally be scheduled for work hours until 
all full-time and part-time staff is scheduled for their hours of work. Travelers and agency staff 
will not be scheduled for work hours until all full-time and part-time employees are scheduled 
for their regular hours. 
Section 4. 
Changes to Posted Schedules 
In the event posted work schedules are changed due to operational needs, the Hospital will make 
a reasonable attempt to make changes which result in the fewest disruptions to posted schedules 
for full-time and part-time as possible, taking into account continuity of patient care and the 
individuals affected by any prior scheduling changes.  Before changes are made to posted 
schedules, the Hospital will make reasonable efforts to fill the staffing needs.  Employees are 
expected to keep the Hospital advised of a telephone number at which they can be reached to 
receive information on schedule changes.  Any scheduled change to a posted schedule with less 
 
19 

than seven (7) days notice will require notification and approval of the employee except in case 
of declared emergencies by the Governor or Federal Government. 
Section 5. 
Applicability of Article 
This Article does not apply to daily reductions in staffing addressed in the Call-Off Procedure 
(Article 18), nor does it apply to extension of hours beyond the scheduled end of a shift due to 
operational needs. 
Section 6. 
Transparency 
The Hospital will maintain records that identify which employees actually worked a given 
schedule and will permit employees to review these records upon request.
