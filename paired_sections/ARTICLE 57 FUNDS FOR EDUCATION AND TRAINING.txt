57.1 
Beginning with calendar year 2022, during each calendar year, the Employer will make 
available a total of 0.22% of the straight time wages of the bargaining unit payroll of the prior 
calendar year while this Agreement was in effect for Hospital-approved training or education 
programs for the direct and indirect improvement in the skills of bargaining unit employees.  
Any unused funds will be carried forward to the next calendar year and will not offset the 
Employer’s commitment to make available the required 0.22% amount on that next calendar 
year.  Upon request made no more frequently than quarterly, the Hospital shall provide an 
accounting to the Union of the balance of funds available and how funds have been spent.
