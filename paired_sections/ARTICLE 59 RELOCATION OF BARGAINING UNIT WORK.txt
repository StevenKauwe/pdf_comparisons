ARTICLE 59 

RELOCATION OF BARGAINING UNIT WORK 
59.1 
Right of Hospital to Relocate Bargaining Unit Work 
This Agreement shall not prohibit the given Hospital from relocating work done by 
bargaining unit employees out of the Hospital to another HCA affiliate, if such relocation is done 
pursuant to a corporate program to consolidate and share services among hospitals.  After such 
relocation to another HCA affiliate, the functions formerly performed by these employees will 
not be performed within the Hospital except by bargaining unit employees.  In the event of such 
a corporate-structure-driven relocation, the Hospital will advise the Union at least thirty (30) 
days in advance of the effective date of the relocations. 
59.2 
Effects of the Relocation. 
(a) A full-time or part-time bargaining unit employee whose job is eliminated as a result 
of relocation of bargaining unit work may bump the least senior bargaining unit employee in 
his/her department/cost center or classification (who has the same or, at the option of the 
employee, lesser status) on the same shift (or on any shift if there is not a less senior employee 
on the same shift), provided that the employee is fully capable of performing the duties of the job 
with no more than ten (10) days of orientation.  In no event shall there be more than one (1) level 
of bumping (i.e. if Employee A is selected for layoff and, by the procedures set forth above, 
Employee A bumps Employee B from his/her job, Employee B has no bumping rights).  An 
employee who bumps into another position pursuant to this Section will be “red circled” at his or 
her current rate (not greater than the max for the new classification) and the Employee’s rate 
would thereafter remain the same until such time he or she would be entitled to an increase based 
on the applicable scale and his or her credited experience. 
Before an employee may bump, the employee may be required to bid on any vacant 
positions in his/her classification, status and shift for which the Hospital believes the employee 
may be qualified.  Selection for such positions will be as set forth in Article 16.  In the event the 
employee is not the successful bidder, he/she may exercise his/her bumping rights provided 
he/she does so by 5:00 p.m. on the second weekday following the day on which he/she was 
notified that he/she was not the successful bidder. 
(b) 
Full-time and part-time bargaining unit employees who experience job loss as a 
result of relocation of bargaining unit work shall be eligible for severance benefits as follows: 
Length of Service 
Weeks of Base Pay 
At least 91 days but less than 3 years 
80 hours (2 weeks) 
3 years but less than 5 years 
120 hours (3 weeks) 
5 years but less than 8 years 
160 hours (4 weeks) 
8 years but less than 10 years 
200 hours (5 weeks)

Length of Service 
Weeks of Base Pay 
10 years but less than 15 years 
320 hours (8 weeks) 
15 years but less than 20 years 
400 hours (10 weeks) 
20 years or more 
480 hours (12 weeks) 

Severance pay under this subsection shall be paid based on the employee’s status.  Severance pay 
will be paid on a bi-weekly basis.  In addition, the Hospital will continue to provide insurance 
coverage in effect at the time of the job loss at the same cost that was in effect immediately prior 
to the job loss (except to the extent the cost of such coverage increases during the severance 
period) to employees who have experienced job loss for the same period as the severance pay. 
All severance entitlement and payments will cease upon the earlier of return to work or 
fourteen (14) days from the mailing of a written communication (sent by certified mail) of 
available employment. 
This severance pay provision shall not apply if the Employee declines to interview for, 
declines an offer of, or accepts continued employment with the Hospital or an HCA affiliate at a 
base salary level that is at least 85% of the Employee’s most recent base salary with the Hospital.  
Base salary shall mean the Employee’s base wage rate times his or her full-time equivalent 
(FTE).  The offer of employment must be in a position for which qualifications are substantially 
similar to the position previously held by the Employee or a position where the Employee has the 
previous experience and/or qualifications and is capable of performing the work. 
In the event the Employee continues employment or accepts an offer of employment from 
an HCA affiliate in a job for which the base salary is more than 15% below the Employee’s most 
recent base salary with the Hospital, the Employee will be eligible for a prorated severance 
payment.  The prorated severance amount will be determined by subtracting the new salary from 
the most recent base salary, and multiplying that amount by the number of weeks outlined in the 
severance schedule above. 
In the case of failure to accept employment offered by an HCA affiliate, consideration 
will be given to the Employee’s commuting distance.  Eligibility for severance will not be 
affected by failure to accept employment at an affiliate which is greater than 25 miles from the 
Employee’s home or is not comparable to the Employee’s prior commute (if longer than 25 
miles). 
Employees who accept re-employment with the Hospital or an HCA affiliate within 90 
calendar days of separation may only retain a pro-rated portion of the severance payment. 
Upon request the Hospital will bargain with the Union over any other effects of the 
relocation on bargaining unit employees.  The severance benefits set forth in this subsection 59.2 
and any other rights and benefits that result from any effects bargaining conducted pursuant to 
this subsection 59.2 shall be the exclusive rights and benefits to which employees who 
experience job loss as a result of a relocation of bargaining unit work are entitled and shall be in 
lieu of any other rights and benefits set forth in this Agreement for employees who experience 
job loss, including but not limited to those rights and benefits set forth in Article 15, 
Layoff/Recall.

59.3 
Use of Agency and Traveler Employees 
This Article does not prohibit the use of agency or traveler employees from an HCA 
affiliate consistent with the Hospital’s historical usage of such temporary employees to 
supplement staffing.
