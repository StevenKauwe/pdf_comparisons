SAFETY AND HEALTH 
36.1 
Safe Work Place. 
The Hospital shall comply with all state and federal laws and regulations concerning 
workplace safety.  Employees should report any safety concerns to the Hospital’s Safety Officer. 
No employee shall be required to work under conditions that would be hazardous to the 
employee’s safety in violation of state or federal law.  No employee will be disciplined or 
retaliated against for reporting such conditions.  If the Hospital does not remedy a safety issue 
within a reasonable period of time, the employee or the union shall be free to contact the 
appropriate state or federal agencies concerning the matter.  Disputes concerning conditions of 
health and safety within the Hospital shall not be subject to the grievance and arbitration 
procedures of this agreement, but shall be subject to the applicable administrative procedures 
established by federal and Nevada laws.  Issues arising under this Section of this Article may be 
addressed by the Labor-Management/Patient Care Committee. 
36.2 
Infectious and Communicable Disease Control. 
The Hospital shall continue to maintain a program of infectious and communicable 
disease control.  Except as required by law, the Hospital shall not be obligated to provide for or 
pay for COVID-19 testing; however, the expense of testing may be covered under health 
insurance benefits.  The Hospital will continue to provide Hepatitis B & C testing (following 
workplace exposure), titer testing (as required) and vaccines (if needed) for measles, mumps, 
chicken pox, rubella and rubeola, TB screening or testing (on employment, annually and 
following workplace exposure), HIV testing (following workplace exposure), flu vaccines 
(during flu season), COVID-19 vaccine (as recommended by the CDC), the Hepatitis B vaccine 
series (as required or upon request), and any other vaccination required by the Hospital at no cost 
to employees.  In the event that a federal, state, county, or other governmental authority 
implements a voluntary smallpox vaccination program for bargaining unit employees, the 
Hospital will bargain over the effect of the program on bargaining unit employees.  Such items 
for bargaining include what training, education, and counseling should be provided to employees 
to help them decide whether they should volunteer for vaccination, the content of an informed 
consent form, plans for on-site monitoring and care of vaccination site and tracking and reporting 
of complications, a no discrimination provision for non-participation, and what type of 
vaccination needles will be used.  The Union will initiate such bargaining by providing the 
Hospital with written proposals on each of the foregoing subjects and the parties will thereafter 
meet to bargain over the issues for up to thirty (30) days.

paid time and will be treated as hours worked. 
36.3 
Harassment. 
The Hospital does not tolerate unlawful harassment or threats of physical harm to or by 
its employees. 
The Hospital shall take reasonable steps within its control to protect employees from 
assault or unlawful harassment.  Complaints of such conduct should first be directed to the 
employee’s immediate supervisor.  If the immediate supervisor’s response fails to resolve the 
matter within a reasonable time, the employee should reduce the complaint to writing within 
fourteen (14) calendar days of the occurrence and submit the complaint to the Director of Labor 
Relations or his or her designee for review and investigation.  The Director of Labor Relations or 
his or her designee will meet with the complaining employee(s) and Union Representative (if 
desired by the employee) within eight (8) calendar days.  The Director of Labor Relations or his 
or her designee will respond to the employee(s) (and the Union if involved), within seven (7) 
calendar days from the date of the meeting as to the disposition of such complaint. 
The resolution of such complaints by the Director of Labor Relations or his or her 
designee shall be subject to the grievance or arbitration provisions of this Agreement.
