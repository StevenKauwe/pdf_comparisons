UNION ACCESS AND COMMUNICATIONS 
3.1 
Bulletin Boards. 
The Hospital will provide the Union with a lockable bulletin board at least 24 by 36 
inches located in the Hospital’s cafeteria for the posting of Union notices, and five similar boards 
located as follows: two (2) by the service elevators in the main (adult) Hospital, two (2) by the 
service elevators in the Children’s Hospital, and one (1) near the EVS time clock.  Each notice 
shall be signed and dated by the Union Representative posting the notice and a copy of each 
notice shall be delivered to the office of the Director of Labor Relations or his or her designee 
without unreasonable delay upon being posted.  The Union may also post communications on 
existing employee bulletin boards located in employee break rooms and employee lounges.  
Employee break rooms and employee lounges’ bulletin board space will be respectfully shared 
by employees, the Union, and the Hospital.  No materials will be posted that are critical of any 
Hospital employee or of any policy relating to patient care or the delivery of patient care at the 
Hospital.  The Hospital will provide the Union with access and a key to the Bulletin Boards 
identified above.  In the event the key is misplaced, the Union will pay the Hospital a fee of 
$150.00 to rekey the Bulletin Board locks.  The Hospital will not access any Union bulletin 
board to remove union literature, unless a request has been made to the Union, in writing, of a 
serious and clear violation of the foregoing.  Repeated violations of this policy by Union 
Representatives shall be grounds for revocation of the posting rights granted by this Article.  If 
the Union wishes to grieve any limitation on access implemented pursuant to this Section, it may 
do so by filing a grievance directly at arbitration. 
3.2 
Union Staff Representatives. 
3.2.1 
Authorized Representatives.  Authorized representatives of the Union 
(including off duty union stewards) shall be permitted to enter the Hospital 
at any time the Hospital is in operation to see that the provisions of this 
Agreement are being observed.  The representative may confer with 
bargaining unit employees on their non-working time in cafeterias, 
 
4 
employee break rooms, or employee lounges.  Such conferences shall not 
interfere with the operation of the Hospital.  Union representatives shall 
not interrupt the work of employees who are on working time for any 
reason.  Union Representatives will not enter enclosed working areas of 
the Hospital or other areas that are not open to visitors, other than 
employee-break rooms and employee lounges.  Before accessing Hospital 
property, union representatives shall comply with Hospital badging 
requirements.  The Union will inform the Hospital in writing by e-mail of 
the names of its then-current authorized representatives and will timely 
provide updated lists when there are changes to the representatives or 
upon request of the Hospital.  In order for a union representative to be 
eligible for access to the Hospital, the Union must provide the Hospital in 
advance (i) a criminal background check obtained within the last five (5) 
months containing the information in the form currently provided; (ii) a 
current TB test; and (iii) the union representative’s attestation of 
compliance with the Hospital’s then-current influenza policy.  If the 
Hospital concludes the information provided is acceptable, it will notify 
the Union within two (2) business days that the union representative is 
eligible to obtain a badge and access the facility. The Hospital may 
condition a union representative’s continued eligibility for a badge on 
successfully passing and complying with the same requirements on the 
same basis and frequency as it requires of its employees. The Hospital 
shall provide the Union prompt notice of any changes in these 
requirements. 
3.2.2 
Notice of Arrival.  The representative of the Union shall notify the 
Director of Labor Relations or his or her designee of his/her intended 
arrival on Hospital property by text message no more than three (3) hours, 
but not less than one (1) hours, in advance of arrival; however, notice 
thirty (30) minutes in advance of arrival is acceptable for a Union 
Representative coming to the Hospital to represent an employee subject to 
a drug and/or alcohol test. 
3.2.3 
Twice per month, the Hospital will give the Union access (subject to 
availability) to a conference room (which may be an MOB conference 
room if a Hospital conference room is not available at the time the Union 
makes the request) for the purpose of determining whether this agreement 
is being observed, to investigate a grievance, or for education and training: 
(1) 
Such sessions may last up to four (4) hours. 
(2) 
The Union must request a room from the Director of Labor Relations or 
his or her designee and such request will be granted, subject to availability.  
Once space is reserved, the Hospital will not cancel the space (without 
offering alternative space sufficient for the needs of the meeting) except in 
the case of an emergent need for the space which would have resulted in 
cancellation of a departmental or human resources meeting in such space. 
 
5 
(3) 
Access to the room provided shall be limited to no more than two (2) 
Union representatives at a time (local or international staff and full-time 
elected officers of the union), unless mutually agreed to more.  Non-
employees who are not associated with the Union may be permitted to 
attend meetings with advance notice and the agreement of the Director of 
Labor Relations or his or her designee. 
3.2.4 
Enforcement of Access Provisions.  During the term of this Agreement, if 
the Hospital believes that Union representatives are repeatedly violating 
the limitations on access set forth in Sections 3.2.1, 3.2.2 and 3.2.3, the 
Hospitals shall request and conduct within two (2) business days a 
meeting with representatives of the Union to discuss and attempt to 
informally resolve the Hospital’s concerns.  In the event that the 
Hospital’s concerns are not resolved to the Hospital’s satisfaction within 
seven (7) calendar days of its request for such a meeting, the Hospital may 
submit the issue to arbitration before Arbitrator Richard Ahearn (or 
another arbitrator mutually selected by the parties) If a Union 
Representative repeatedly materially or grossly interferes with the work of 
an employee or Hospital operations, the Hospital may revoke that Union 
Representative’s access pending resolution with the Union or Arbitrator 
Ahearn (or another arbitrator mutually selected by the parties).  Prior to 
revoking access, the Hospital will provide advance notice to the Union and 
an opportunity to discuss resolution of the issue.  The same procedure 
shall apply in the event that the Union believes that Management 
representatives are repeatedly violating the Union’s access and bulletin 
board rights.  If the arbitrator determines that Union representatives have 
repeatedly violated the limitations on access set forth in Sections 3.2.1, 
3.2.2 and/or 3.2.3, the Arbitrator will be empowered to fashion an 
appropriate remedy regarding the limitations or suspension of access 
rights for specific Union representatives.  If the arbitrator determines that 
Management representatives have repeatedly violated the limitations on 
access set forth in Sections 3.2.1, 3.2.2 and/or 3.2.3, the arbitrator will be 
empowered to fashion an appropriate remedy sufficient to enforce these 
rights. 
3.3 
New Member Orientation. 
The Hospital shall allot up to thirty (30) minutes during or at the end of general 
orientation for a brief information presentation by Union Representatives or Stewards to be 
designated by the Union.  The Union’s presentation will be included as an item on the new 
employee orientation agenda.  The parties understand that the purpose of this meeting is to 
present non-controversial information concerning the Union to the orientees, and that 
management will not be present during such presentations.  Orientees who chose to attend will 
be paid for such time at their straight time hourly rates.  The Hospital will provide the Union 
with a schedule of general orientation sessions at least two (2) weeks in advance.

3.4 
In the event the Hospital believes that the Union is repeatedly violating the prohibition 
against presenting controversial information during orientation, the Hospital may be request an 
immediate meeting with representatives of the Union to discuss and attempt to informally 
resolve the Hospital’s concerns.  In the event that the Hospital’s concerns are not resolved to the 
Hospital’s satisfaction within seven (7) calendar days of its request for such a meeting, the 
Hospital may submit the issue to arbitration by requesting, with a copy to the Union, that the 
Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service submit a panel of seven (7) arbitrators having 
Hospital arbitration experience.  The arbitrator will be selected in the same manner as set forth in 
Article 10.  The same procedure shall apply in the event that the Union believes that 
Management representatives are repeatedly violating the Union’s right to make presentations at 
orientation as set forth above.  If the arbitrator determines that Union representatives have 
repeatedly presented controversial information during orientation, the Arbitrator will be 
empowered to fashion an appropriate remedy regarding the limitations or suspension of the right 
to attend orientation for specific Union representatives.  If the arbitrator determines that 
Management representatives have repeatedly violated the union’s right to make presentations at 
orientation, the arbitrator will be empowered to fashion an appropriate remedy sufficient to 
enforce these rights.
