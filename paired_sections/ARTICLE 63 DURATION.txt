USE OF HOSPITAL ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION FACILITIES 
Hospital electronic communication facilities (Meditech, E-mail) are intended to be used 
only for official Hospital business. Occasional use of the Hospital’s Meditech or E-mail system 
by employees for personal communications or messages of a non-controversial nature is 
permitted, so long as the communication is reasonably limited in the scope of its distribution. No 
personal messages shall be broadcast Hospital-wide and no messages shall be sent over the 
Hospital’s Meditech or E-mail system which contain statements which are critical of any 
individuals or of any policy, practice, or service of the Hospital or any of its affiliates. 
ARTICLE 56 

EXTRA SHIFT DIFFERENTIAL 
The Hospital may implement an extra shift differential for RNs and LPNs in a given unit 
or units whenever it deems it necessary to supplement staffing. When implemented within a 
given unit, the differential will apply to full twelve (12) hour shifts worked in excess of six (6) 
full twelve (12) hour shifts in a pay period by full time, part-time, and VSP RNs and LPNs. 
In order to qualify for the differential, the employee must have no call-ins during the pay 
period and work a seventh or more twelve (12) hour shift (s). Non-productive hours (PTO, EIB, 
and other hours not actually worked) do not count as shifts worked. The extra shift differential 
shall be: 

Extra twelve (12) hour day shift during the week = $5.00/hour 

Extra twelve (12) hour day shift on the weekend = $7.50/hour 

Extra twelve (12) hour night shift during the week = $7.50/hour 

Extra twelve (12) hour night shift on the weekend = $7.50/hour
