LAYOFF/RECALL 
15.1 
Reduction in Staff. 
15.1.1 
Job Security, Indefinite Layoff and Practical Alternatives to Avoid the 
Need for Layoff. 
The Hospital will make every reasonable effort to avoid displacing (i.e., laying off 
or permanently reducing the hours of) full-time and part-time bargaining unit 
members. Such efforts may include use of attrition, business growth, job 
matching, retraining, assistance to employees in identifying other job 
opportunities in other departments or at other HCA affiliated hospitals, and/or 
other mutually agreed upon mechanisms to accomplish the goal of avoiding such 
displacements.  However, the parties recognize that there are times when such 
displacements will occur.  When the Hospital determines that it is necessary to 
displace full-time or part-time bargaining unit employees, it will notify the Union 
and will, upon request, meet and bargain with the Union at reasonable times 
during the thirty (30) day period following such notice (unless extended by 
mutual agreement).  The subject of such bargaining will be the need for the layoff 
and the existence of practical alternatives to avoid the need for the layoff.  In the 
event that an individual full-time or part-time employee is subjected to call-off for 
fourteen (14) consecutive scheduled shifts, the Hospital will, upon request of the 
Union, meet with the Union to bargain over the need for a permanent layoff or 
reduction in hours. 
15.1.1.1 
Disputes Arising Under 15.1.1. Above. 
Disputes arising under 15.1.1. above (including those relating to the need 
for any layoff/permanent reduction in hours and/or the existence of 
practical alternatives to layoff/permanent reduction in hours) which cannot 
 
19 
be resolved through the bargaining process above shall not be subject to 
the grievance and arbitration procedure of this Agreement but shall instead 
be subject to the following procedure, which shall be the exclusive method 
for resolving such disputes under this Agreement. 
15.1.1.1.1 

If the parties are unable to resolve a dispute through the bargaining 
process above, either party may request the assistance of a mediator from 
the FMCS or other mutually agree upon a neutral third party to assist the 
parties in resolving the issue(s). 
15.1.1.1.2 

If the parties are unable to resolve their dispute with the help of the 
mediator within sixty (60) days of the notice of intended layoff/permanent 
reduction in force, the Hospital may proceed with the layoff/reduction on 
the 60th day following the notice. 
15.1.2 
Notice of Layoff and Volunteers. 
The Hospital will give affected employees at least two (2) weeks notice of layoff 
or two (2) weeks pay (based on regularly scheduled hours) in lieu of notice, or a 
combination thereof and will seek volunteers for layoff in the classification, 
department/cost center and shift affected.  If more employees volunteer for layoff 
than are needed, volunteers will be selected on the basis of seniority. 
15.1.3 
Temporary/Travelers Reduced First. 
Temporary employees and Travelers (whose contracts are terminable on two 
weeks notice without penalty; upon signing of this agreement all future traveler 
contracts will be terminable with two weeks notice for a layoff) in the 
classifications to be reduced, shall be laid off before any other employee on the 
shift and cost center in which the reductions are to take place, provided that the 
remaining employees are fully capable of performing the available work. 
15.1.4 
Order of Displacement. 
If an insufficient number of staff volunteer for layoff at the time of notification, 
the least senior employees occupying affected positions in the affected 
department/cost center (see Appendix D) and shift will be initially laid-off. 
15.1.4.1 
Displacement. 
An employee who is subject to layoff will have the right to displace: 
15.1.4.1.1 
A less senior bargaining unit employee in his/her 
department/cost center, (who has the same or, at the option of the employee, lesser status), 
 
20 
provided that the employee is fully capable of performing the duties of the job with no more than 
ten (10) days of orientation, or 
15.1.4.1.2 
The least senior employee in the bargaining unit in his/her 
classification (in the same or, at the option of the employee, lesser status) on the same shift (or 
on any shift if there is not a less senior employee on the same shift), provided that the employee 
is fully capable of performing the duties of the job with no more than ten (10) days of 
orientation. 
15.1.4.1.3 
In the event that the employee cannot displace the least 
senior employee in the bargaining unit in his/her classification and shift, because of difference in 
status or lack of qualifications as set forth above, he/she may continue up the seniority list, until 
he/she is able to displace a less senior employee. 
15.1.4.1.4 
In the event of multiple bumps by employees in the same 
classification the bumps will be executed by the most senior affected employees first. 
15.1.4.1.5 
The foregoing bumping rights shall not apply to any 
employee who has a final written warning within the 12 months preceding his/her notification of 
layoff. 
15.1.4.2 
Obligation to Apply for Vacant Positions Before Bumping. 
Before an employee may bump out of his/her department/cost center, the 
employee may be required to bid on any vacant positions in his/her classification, 
status and shift, outside his/her cost center, for which the Hospital believes the 
employee may be qualified.  Selection for such positions will be as set forth in 
Article 16.  In the event the employee is not the successful bidder, he/she may 
exercise his/her bumping rights provided he/she does so by 5:00 p.m. on the 
second weekday following the day on which he/she was notified that he/she was 
not the successful bidder. 
15.1.4.3 
Bumping into VSP Positions. 
Employees who bump into VSP positions shall be treated in all respects as 
a VSP employee, except that such employees will nevertheless retain recall rights 
to a status position for 12 months (24 months for employees with 5 years of 
service) from layoff as herein provided. 
15.1.4.4 
Possible Conversion of Per Diem Position to a Benefited Position. 
If an employee bumps a VSP employee whom the employee believes to be 
regularly scheduled to work a regular part-time or full-time schedule, the 
employee may request at the time he/she seeks to bump into the position that the 
VSP position be converted to a part-time or full-time position.  The position will 
be so converted if it meets the test for conversion of VSP positions set forth in 
Article 7 (Status of Employment). 
 
21 
15.1.5 
Rights of Bumped Employees. 
An employee who has been displaced by a more senior employee will, in turn, 
have the same options to displace less senior employees as employees initially 
displaced. Employees who are unable to, or choose not to, displace another 
employee under the foregoing procedure will be placed on layoff.  An employee 
displaced under the above process who is offered and declines a position in his or 
her classification, status, and shift (day, evening or night) will be considered to 
have voluntarily resigned.  Once advised of his/her displacement, an employee 
must exercise displacement rights by 5 :00 p.m. on the second weekday following 
the day on which he/she was advised of displacement and is provided access to a 
seniority list from which he/she may determine his/her bumping options. 
15.1.6 
Employees on Leaves of Absence or Vacation. 
Employees who are on an approved leave of absence at notification of 
displacement, will be notified of their displacement by certified mail.  Said 
notification will include a current seniority list and list of vacant bargaining unit 
positions.  The employee must exercise any contractual bumping rights by 5:00 
p.m. on the weekday following the day of return, or by 5:00 p.m. on the 10th 
weekday following delivery or attempted delivery of the certified mail notice of 
displacement and telephone calls to the employee’s telephone number of record, 
whichever is earlier. 
15.2 
Recall Roster. 
15.2.1 

Employees shall be placed on a recall roster for a period of twelve (12) months 
(24 months for employees with 5 or more years of service) from the date of 
layoff, or for a period equal to the employee’s length of unbroken service with the 
Hospital in any bargaining unit position in any of the bargaining units covered by 
this Agreement, whichever is shorter.  An employee placed on the recall roster 
shall provide and keep updated while on the recall roster, a current address and 
telephone number where the employee can be reached. 
15.2.2 
Order of Recall. 
Employees on layoff will be recalled to available positions in the classification, 
department/cost center and shift from which they were laid off in the inverse order 
of seniority, provided they are fully qualified to perform the available work with 
no more than ten (10) days of orientation.  A recalled employee must accept recall 
by 5:00 p.m. on the second weekday following the day on which notification of 
recall is served (in the case of service by certified mail shall be considered 
effective three (3) days after delivery or attempted delivery) on the employee and 
return to work at the Hospital within fourteen (14) days of such service.  
Notification of recall may be served by direct verbal communication or by written 
communication by certified mail sent to the employee’s address of record.  If the 
 
22 
employee does not accept recall and return to work within the foregoing time 
limits, the employee will be considered to have voluntarily resigned.  If an offer 
of recall is accepted, the employee shall be deemed recalled and be removed from 
the recall roster. 
Employees on layoff may apply for other vacancies through the employment 
center.  An employee on layoff applying for a vacancy shall be selected over a 
non-employee applicant if he/she has the education, skills, experience and 
abilities required for the vacant position. 
15.2.3 
Refusal of Offer. 
An employee on layoff who declines recall to a position in his or her classification 
on the shift and in the cost center from which he or she was laid off, or who 
declines an offer of recall to any available position for which he or she is qualified 
in the employee’s classification on the same shift from which he or she was laid 
off, will be removed from the recall list and will be separated from employment as 
a voluntary resignation and any severance payments will be discontinued. 
15.2.4 
Reduction in Hours. 
Nothing in this Article will prohibit the Hospital from implementing a temporary 
reduction in scheduled hours for employees in a unit or department for a period 
not to exceed sixty (60) days in order to avoid the necessity of a layoff.  In the 
event of the implementation of such a reduction, traveler (to the extent permitted 
by their contracts), agency, VSP and temporary employees working regularly 
scheduled hours on the affected shift in the affected unit or department will have 
any scheduled hours reduced first, before the hours of regular full-time and part-
time employees in the same classification are reduced, provided the remaining 
employees have the immediate ability to perform the available work.  In the event 
of implementation of such a reduction, full- time and part-time employees 
affected by the reduction will not have their status reduced for benefit purposes. 
15.3 
Alternate Arrangements. 
15.3.1 

Upon mutual agreement, the Union and the Hospital may explore an alternate 
arrangement regarding a reduction in force and implement such an alternate 
arrangement for a given reduction if agreement to do so is reached. 
15.3.2 
Affecting Fewest Number of Employees. 
It is the intention of the Hospital, in implementing layoffs, call-offs, or temporary 
reductions in hours, to affect as few employees as possible, given the Hospital’s 
judgment as to its reasonable operational needs. 
15.4 
Severance Pay. 
 
23 
15.4.1 

Full-time or part-time employees who volunteer (and are selected) for a layoff, or 
who are laid off pursuant to the provisions of this Article, shall be paid the 
following severance benefits: 
Length of Service 
Weeks of Base Pay 
At least 91 days but less than 3 yrs 
80 hours (2 weeks) 
3 yrs but less than 5 yrs 
120 hours (3 weeks) 
5 yrs but less than 8 years 
160 hours (4 weeks) 
8 yrs but less than 10 yrs 
200 hours (5 weeks) 
10 yrs but less than 15 yrs 
320 hours (8 weeks) 
15 yrs but less than 20 yrs 
400 hours (10 weeks) 
20 years or more 
480 hours (12 weeks) 

Severance pay under this subsection shall be paid, based on the employee’s status.  
Severance pay will be paid on a bi-weekly basis.  In addition, the Hospital will 
continue to provide insurance coverage in effect at the time of the layoff at the 
same cost that was in effect immediately prior to the layoff (except to the extent 
the cost of such coverage increases during the severance period) to employees 
who have been laid off or volunteered to be laid off for the same period as the 
severance pay.  All severance entitlement and payments will cease upon the 
earlier of (1) return to work with the Hospital, (2) fourteen (14) days from the 
mailing of a written communication (sent by certified mail) of available 
employment with the Hospital or an HCA-affiliated facility within a 30-mile 
radius of the Hospital, (3) actual employment by the operating entity of a 
subcontracted service, or (4) actual employment by an HCA-affiliated facility.  
This severance pay provision shall not apply in the event of the sale of the 
Hospital or any service or department in which employees are offered 
employment with the new owner.

service with the Hospital in any bargaining unit position in any of the bargaining 
units covered by this Agreement, whichever is shorter.  An employee placed on 
the recall roster shall provide and keep updated while on the recall roster, a 
current address and telephone number where the employee can be reached. 
15.2.2 Order of Recall.  Employees on layoff will be recalled to available positions in the 
classification, department/cost center and shift from which they were laid off in 
the inverse order of seniority, provided they are fully qualified to perform the 
 
23 

available work with no more than ten (10) days of orientation.  A recalled 
employee must accept recall by 5:00 p.m. on the second weekday following the 
day on which notification of recall is served (in the case of service by certified 
mail shall be considered effective three (3) days after delivery or attempted 
delivery) on the employee and return to work at the Hospital within fourteen (14) 
days of such service.  Notification of recall may be served by direct verbal 
communication or by written communication by certified mail sent to the 
employee’s address of record.  
If the employee does not accept recall and return to work within the foregoing 
time limits, the employee will be considered to have voluntarily resigned.  If an 
offer of recall is accepted, the employee shall be deemed recalled and be removed 
from the recall roster.  
Employees on layoff may apply for other vacancies through the employment 
center.  An employee on layoff applying for a vacancy shall be selected over a 
non-employee applicant if he/she has the education, skills, experience and 
abilities required for the vacant position.  
15.2.3 Refusal of Offer.  An employee on layoff who declines recall to a position in his 
or her classification on the shift and in the cost center from which he or she was 
laid off, or who declines an offer of recall to any available position for which he 
or she is qualified in the employee’s classification on the same shift from which 
he or she was laid off, will be removed from the recall list and will be separated 
from employment as a voluntary resignation and any severance payments will be 
discontinued. 
15.2.4 Reduction in Hours.  Nothing in this Article will prohibit the Hospital from 
implementing a temporary reduction in scheduled hours for employees in a unit or 
department for a period not to exceed sixty (60) days in order to avoid the 
necessity of a layoff.  In the event of the implementation of such a reduction, 
traveler (to the extent permitted by their contracts), agency, VSP and temporary 
employees working regularly scheduled hours on the affected shift in the affected 
unit or department will have any scheduled hours reduced first, before the hours 
of regular full-time and part-time employees in the same classification are 
reduced, provided the remaining employees have the immediate ability to perform 
the available work.  In the event of implementation of such a reduction, full-time 
and part-time employees affected by the reduction will not have their status 
reduced for benefit purposes. 
15.3 
Alternate Arrangements. 
15.3.1 Upon mutual agreement, the Union and the Hospital may explore an alternate 
arrangement regarding a reduction in force and implement such an alternate 
arrangement for a given reduction if agreement to do so is reached.

15.3.2 Affecting Fewest Number of Employees.  It is the intention of the Hospital, in 
implementing layoffs, call-offs, or temporary reductions in hours, to affect as few 
employees as possible, given the Hospital’s judgment as to its reasonable 
operational needs.

Severance pay under this subsection shall be paid, based on the employee’s status. 
Severance pay will be paid on a bi-weekly basis.  In addition, the Hospital will continue to 
provide insurance coverage in effect at the time of the layoff at the same cost that was in effect 
immediately prior to the layoff (except to the extent the cost of such coverage increases during 
the severance period) to employees who have been laid off or volunteered to be laid off for the 
same period as the severance pay.  All severance entitlement and payments will cease upon the 
earlier of (1) return to work with the Hospital, (2) fourteen (14) days from the mailing of a 
written communication (sent by certified mail) of available employment with the Hospital or an 
HCA-affiliated facility within a 30-mile radius of the Hospital, (3) actual employment by the 
operating entity of a subcontracted service, of (4) employment by an HCA-affiliated facility.  
This severance pay provision shall not apply in the event of the sale of the Hospital or any 
service or department in which employees are offered employment with the new owner.
