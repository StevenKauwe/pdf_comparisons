SHOP STEWARDS 
4.1 
Written Notification of Union Stewards. 
The Union will provide the Hospital in writing or by email with a list of those employees 
who are stewards and will timely provide updated lists when there are changes to stewards. 
4.2 
Assisting Employees. 
Shop Stewards are responsible for informing bargaining unit employees of their rights 
and responsibilities under this Agreement, to ascertain that the terms and conditions of this 
Agreement are being observed, and to investigate and assist in the processing of grievances.  If 
Shop Stewards attend meetings or investigate grievances during working time with the Hospital’s 
permission, they will suffer no loss of pay.  Such permission will not arbitrarily be denied. 
4.3 
Upon advance written request, the Employer will make reasonable efforts to provide up 
to five (5) days without pay per calendar year to Shop Stewards for the purpose of participating 
in Union educational programs, provided that coverage can be obtained without the need for 
premium payor registry. 
4.4 
Upon advance written request, shop stewards will be permitted to leave their normal 
work to attend the monthly shop steward meeting or address bargaining unit orientees at general 
orientation sessions without loss of pay.  The Employer will not unreasonably deny such 
requests.  No more than four (4) hours of such release time per month will be granted to a 
maximum of one steward per every twenty-five (25) bargaining unit employees up to a 
maximum of twenty (20).  Such paid release time may be accumulated from month to month up 
to a maximum of 960 hours.

4.5 
Weingarten Rights. 
In connection with investigatory interviews required by the Hospital which an employee 
reasonably believes will result in disciplinary action being taken against him/her, an employee 
upon his/her request shall be entitled to have a shop steward or field representative present, 
provided that such investigatory interviews will not be delayed if a shop steward or field 
representative will not be available within twenty-four (24) hours.  It is understood that the role 
of the shop steward or field representative shall be strictly limited to the rights accorded such 
representatives by the NLRB. 
4.6 
Negotiating Committee. 
Except to the extent that patient care needs dictate otherwise, members of the Union 
negotiating committee will be granted time off without pay (or PTO at the employees option) on 
the day of negotiation sessions, and further, in the event a bargaining unit committee member is 
scheduled on a shift contiguous to the starting time of negotiations, that committee member shall 
upon timely request be scheduled off from work as well.  In order to effectuate this, the parties 
will make every effort to establish bargaining dates as far in advance as possible.  Nothing in this 
Section requires the Hospital to release an employee for a date if the coverage cannot be found 
without overtime, on-call, or registry usage if the manager does not receive the request for the 
time off within at least seventy-two (72) hours after negotiations dates are set.  The Hospital shall 
have no duty under this Article to accommodate a request for time off which is not 
communicated as soon as practicable, but no later than within seventy-two (72) hours after a date 
of negotiations is established.

UNION STEWARDS 
Section 1. 
Selection and Notification 
The Hospital will recognize up to twelve (12) Union Stewards from the bargaining unit, one of 
whom shall be designated by the Union as Chief Steward, not including the Vice-President.  
Such Stewards shall be selected by the Union to investigate and process grievances and, upon 
request of the employee, to represent individual bargaining unit members in investigatory 
meetings which may result in discipline of the employee, and perform other Union representative 
duties.  The Union will furnish the Hospital with written or by email notification of a list of the 
names of its Union Stewards, who shall be currently employed in, or on an approved leave of 
absence, or other absence as provided in this Agreement from, bargaining unit positions and will 
timely provide updated lists when there are changes to Union Stewards. 
Section 2. 
Investigation and Processing of Grievances 
Union Stewards, when their presence is necessary at an investigatory or grievance meeting called 
by management during their work time, shall leave their work to attend such meetings, only with 
the prior permission of their supervisor (which shall not be unreasonably denied).  Stewards 
attending such meetings during their work time shall be paid for such portion of the time spent in 
such meetings as corresponds to their scheduled work hours.  Only one (1) Steward shall be 
allowed to represent an employee during any one shift, regardless of the number of employees 
involved in a particular grievance, unless the parties agree to the non-participating presence of 
another newly appointed steward for training purposes. 
Grievance meetings will normally be scheduled during the non-working time of the grievant.  
Time spent in grievance meetings by grievants will be unpaid time except to the extent that a 
grievance meeting is scheduled during the grievant’s working time for the convenience of the 
Hospital, in which case the grievant will be paid for attendance at such meeting.  Investigation of 
grievances by Union Stewards outside of grievance meetings shall be conducted on the non-
working time of all involved bargaining unit employees.  Time spent in arbitration hearings by 
Stewards, grievants, and witnesses called by the Union shall be unpaid time.  With reasonable 
notice, the Hospital shall grant a request for unpaid leave to Stewards, grievants, and Union 
witnesses in order to attend and participate in an arbitration hearing. 
Section 3. 
Negotiating Committee 
Except to the extent that patient care needs dictate otherwise, members of the Union negotiating 
committee will be granted time off without pay (or PTO at the employees option) on the day of 
negotiation sessions, and further, in the event a bargaining unit committee member is scheduled 
on a shift contiguous to the starting time of negotiations, that committee member shall upon 
timely request be scheduled off from work as well.  In order to effectuate this, the parties will

make every effort to establish bargaining dates as far in advance as possible.  Nothing in this 
Section requires the Hospital to release an employee for a date if the coverage cannot be found 
without overtime, on-call, or registry usage if the manager does not receive the request for the 
time off within at least seventy-two (72) hours after negotiations dates are set.  The Hospital 
shall have no duty under this Article to accommodate a request for time off which is not 
communicated as soon as practicable, but no later than within seventy-two (72) hours after a date 
of negotiations is established.

process grievances and, upon request of the employee, to represent individual bargaining unit 
members in investigatory meetings which may result in discipline of the employee, and perform 
other Union representative duties.  The Union will furnish the Hospital with written or by email

Negotiating Committee.  
Except to the extent that patient care needs dictate otherwise, members of the Union 
negotiating committee will be granted time off without pay (or Paid Time Off [“PTO”] at the 
employees option) on the day of negotiation sessions, and further, in the event a bargaining unit 
committee member is scheduled on a shift contiguous to the starting time of negotiations, that 
committee member shall upon timely request be scheduled off from work as well.  In order to 
effectuate this, the parties will make every effort to establish bargaining dates at least seven (7) 
weeks in advance.  Nothing in this Section requires the Hospital to release an employee for a 
date if the coverage cannot be found without overtime, on-call, or registry usage if the manager 
does not receive the request for the time off at least six (6) weeks prior to the date of 
negotiations.  The Hospital shall have no duty under this Article to accommodate a request for 
time off which is not communicated as soon as practicable (but no later than five (5) calendar 
days) after a date of negotiations is established.
