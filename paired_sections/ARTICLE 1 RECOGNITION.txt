ARTICLE 1 

RECOGNITION 
1.1 
Exclusive Bargaining Representative. 
The Hospital recognizes the Union as the sole and exclusive bargaining representative of 
those employees in the following bargaining units (which are hereby combined into a single 
bargaining unit): all RNs, technical employees, business office clerical employees, and all other 
non-professional employees, but excluding all confidential employees, guards and supervisors.  
The list of those current classifications falling within each of these bargaining units is set forth in 
Appendix C to this Agreement. 
1.2 
Departmental Lists. 
The Departments/Cost Centers employing bargaining unit employees as of the effective 
date of this agreement are set forth in Appendix D, hereto. 
1.3 
Withdrawal of Recognition. 
The Hospital agrees not to and expressly waives any right it may have to withdraw 
recognition concerning, to petition for unit clarification concerning, or in any other way to 
challenge the inclusion in the bargaining unit of any employees or classifications or job titles 
who or which are currently included in the unit on the grounds that they are or may be 
supervisors or supervisory. 
1.4 
Bargaining Unit Work. 
1.4.1 
The Employer shall not establish jobs or job titles for the purpose of 
excluding work or employees from the bargaining unit as established in 
this Article of the Agreement and shall not hire or utilize existing 
supervisors who are not part of the bargaining unit to perform bargaining 
unit work except as consistent with past practice, provided that 
supervisory employees shall not be utilized to displace bargaining unit 
employees in order to increase their own hours, or to fill positions 
previously occupied by bargaining unit employees, nor shall they be used 
to indefinitely reduce or limit hours of work for bargaining unit 
employees.  Nothing in this Article will prohibit supervisors employed by 
 
2 
the Hospital from performing bargaining unit work in the course of a 
strike or lockout. 
1.4.2 
The Employer and the Union recognize and acknowledge that certain 
community-based special programs (for example, JTPA, Developmentally 
Disabled Programs, use of volunteers, students, youth programs, etc.) 
serve an important public function and may be used by the Hospital at 
their sole discretion to further that function.  The parties agree that non-
employee participants in such programs shall not displace bargaining unit 
employees or the hours of bargaining unit employees.  Information on any 
such programs, including the number of participants, their classification, 
duties, work locations, hours per week, and the duration of the program 
shall be furnished to the Union at any time, upon request. 
1.5 
New Classifications. 
This Agreement shall apply to other classifications that may be established by the 
Hospital within the scope of duties now and historically included within the listed classifications.  
Any dispute as to the applicability of this agreement to newly created positions will be resolved 
by the National Labor Relations Board.  In the event the Hospital establishes a new job 
classification which is within the bargaining unit, the Hospital will advise the Union of the 
proposed wage rate for the position at least thirty (30) days in advance of when it intends to fill 
the position and will bargain in good faith with the Union upon request over such wage rate.  If 
the parties are unable to reach agreement on the wage rate for such new job classification within 
thirty (30) days of the notification to the Union, the Hospital may implement said wage rate 
pending agreement on a different rate (which, if agreed upon, would be implemented 
prospectively only).  If the parties are unable to reach agreement on the pay rate for the newly 
established position after good faith negotiations, the matter may be subject to arbitration.
