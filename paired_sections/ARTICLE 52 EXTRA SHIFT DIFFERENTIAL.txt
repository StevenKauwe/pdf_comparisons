EXTRA SHIFT DIFFERENTIAL 
The Hospital may implement an extra shift differential for RNs and LPNs in a given unit 
or units whenever it deems it necessary to supplement staffing.  When implemented within a 
given unit, the differential will apply to full twelve (12) hour shifts worked in excess of six (6) 
full twelve (12) hour shifts in a pay period by full-time, part-time, and VSP RNs and LPNs. 
In order to qualify for the differential, the employee must have no call-ins during the pay 
period and work a seventh or more twelve (12) hour shift (s).  Non-productive hours (PTO, EIB, 
and other hours not actually worked) do not count as shifts worked.  The extra shift differential 
shall be: 
Extra twelve (12) hour day shift during the week = $5.00/hour 
Extra twelve (12) hour day shift on the weekend = $7.50/hour 
Extra twelve (12) hour night shift during the week = $7.50/hour 
Extra twelve (12) hour night shift on the weekend = $7.50/hour
