worked premium, the employee must work at least four (4) or more consecutive hours during the

closure of the department) that the employee would otherwise have been scheduled to work.  If 
the holiday falls on Saturday, the observed holiday will be Friday in departments that are 
scheduled to be open Monday through Friday.  If the holiday falls on Sunday, the observed 
holiday will be Monday for departments that are scheduled to be open Monday through Friday. 
Employees will be compensated holiday differential paid at one and one-half times their 
base rate for hours worked on the “actual” holiday - not the observed holiday. 
Holiday differential shall not be an offset against overtime premiums due, but holiday 
differential shall not be included in the regular rate of pay for overtime purposes.
