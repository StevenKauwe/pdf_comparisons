SENIORITY 
13.1 
Definition of Seniority. 
Hospital-wide seniority shall be defined as an employee’s unbroken length of service 
with the Hospital since the most recent date of hire into a full-time or part-time position. 
Classification seniority shall be defined as an employee’s unbroken length of service within their 
current classification as a full-time or part-time employee. 
When a new classification is established, the Hospital will meet with the Union to 
determine if employees transferring from other classifications should receive classification 
seniority credit for prior service in another classification (for example, where the newly 
established classification is merely a progression from an existing classification). 
By way of illustration, classification seniority in the following classifications will be 
transferable to the identified classifications as follows: 
 
16 
Classification seniority in this classification 
Is transferable to this classification 
RCPI 
RCP II 
RCP II 
RCP III 
Any RN classification 
Any RN classification 

In addition, in the event an employee’s position is eliminated and the employee, rather 
than bumping another employee, in his/her classification, applies for and is awarded a position in 
a different classification, the employee’s Hospital seniority shall apply for all purposes. 
Upon announcement of a layoff or other event affecting bargaining unit employees where 
seniority is relevant, the Hospital shall furnish the Union with a seniority list showing for each 
potentially affected employee the name, job classification, and the classification and Hospital 
seniority dates. Such lists shall be posted or available for review in any affected cost center, 
department or unit. 
13.2 
Application of Seniority. 
During the first eighteen (18) months following a voluntary change in classification or 
department/cost center (see Appendix D), seniority in the new job classification or 
department/cost center will apply for purposes of vacation request, holiday rotation, and bidding 
on available shift assignments.  After an employee has been in a classification or department/cost 
center for eighteen (18) months, Hospital seniority will apply for all purposes 
13.3 
Termination of Seniority / Break in Service. 
An employee’s seniority and employment relationship with the Hospital shall terminate 
upon the occurrence of any of the following: 
• Resignation, unless the employee returns to a full-time or part-time position 
within ninety (90) calendar days; 
• Discharge for just cause; 
• For employees with less than five (5) years of service, layoff or a period of twelve 
(12) months from the date of layoff; 
• For employees with five (5) or more years of service, layoff for a period of 
twenty-four (24) months from the date of layoff; 
• In the event an employee transfers to a non-bargaining unit position in the 
Hospital and later returns to a bargaining unit position, without a break in full-
time/part-time service, the employee will be credited with that hospital and 
classification seniority which the employee had at the time the employee 
transferred out of the bargaining unit position; 
• When a full-time or part-time employee changes status to VSP and later returns to 
a full-time or part-time position, he/she will be credited with prior seniority status.
