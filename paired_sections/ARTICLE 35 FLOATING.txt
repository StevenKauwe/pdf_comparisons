ARTICLE 35 

FLOATING 
35.1 
Employees will float to units as directed, but will not be required to perform duties for 
which they are not qualified.  Employees may be temporarily assigned to a unit for the purposes 
of orientation and training to enable the employee to float to the unit in the future.  An employee 
who is on call (stand-by) and receiving call pay shall not be required to float to another 
department during a call back.  If an employee is working an overtime shift, or an extra shift (not 
applicable to VSP) the employee will not be required to float unless there is no other available 
qualified employee to float. 
35.2 
It is understood by the parties that staffing patterns are variable due to fluctuations in 
census.  Such fluctuations may result in employees covered by this Agreement floating to other 
units prior to the completion of their shift.  For the purpose of this policy “float” means 
temporary assignment to a unit other than their regularly assigned unit.  When the Hospital 
makes a determination that floating employees (for reasons other than training or orientation) is 
necessary, employees will be floated from a given unit within a given classification, in the 
following order: 
35.2.1 
Solicited volunteers. 
35.2.2 
Agency employees. 
35.2.3 
Travelers. 
35.2.4 
VSP employees (whether regularly scheduled or on-call) 
35.2.5 
All other employees on a rotational basis. 
 
43 
35.2.6 
A log will be maintained for validation and equity purposes in relation to 
the rotation referred to in 37.2.5 above.  The log will be kept on the unit 
and will be available for employee review. 
35.2.7 
Rotation will continue in current order upon ratification of this 
Agreement. 
35.2.8 
If a preceptor is floated, while orientating an employee, both the preceptor 
and the orientee will be floated.  However, a new employee will not be 
floated independently during the first 12 weeks following completion of 
orientation. 
35.2.9 
Exceptions to, or departures from, the sequence set forth in this paragraph 
may occur, if, in the good faith judgment of the Hospital, the employee 
scheduled to float does not possess the skills required in the receiving unit 
or has unique skills needed in the giving unit. 
35.3 

35.3.1 
Employees will not be floated outside their “like units” except to take 
“tasking” assignments (will not be assigned his/her own patients).  
“Tasking” means to assist an employee in a unit to care for a patient(s) 
who remains assigned to the employee in the unit.  Floating to another unit 
to care for patients who are being held in that unit pending the availability 
of beds in a “like unit” is considered floating to a “like unit.”Space 
permitting, employees whose jobs do not require certifications (NRP, 
PALS, ACLS, Chemotherapy) may take such courses on their non-
working time and will not be charged for the cost of the course.  
Whenever a registered nurse is floated, the assignment will be made by the 
Charge Nurse/Supervisor commensurate with skills/competency of the 
floatee, the needs of the patients, the type of technology required in the 
unit, and the degree of supervision required. 
35.3.2 
Concerns over Floating Assignments 
35.3.2.1 
Whenever an employee is floated, the Charge Nurse/Supervisor 
will assign a core staff (or the Charge Nurse/Supervisor himself or 
herself) to the employee as a resource.  An employee who floats 
will be held accountable to the demonstrated competencies on 
his/her competency checklist. 
35.3.2.2 
Any concerns the employee has about his/her competency for the 
assignment should be voiced to the Charge Nurse/Supervisor at the 
time of assignment. 
35.3.3 
The Charge Nurse/Supervisor for the receiving unit will consult with the 
Charge Nurse/Supervisor for the giving unit, as well as the staff from the 
current and previous shift (if available) regarding patient care needs and 
 
44 
will then re-evaluate the appropriateness of the assignment.  If the 
employee and the Charge Nurse/Supervisor are unable to resolve the 
floatee’s concerns, the Charge Nurse/Supervisor will notify the Unit or 
Department Manager/Clinical Manager on duty and these individuals will 
consult regarding the appropriateness of the assignment. 
35.3.4 
If the Unit/Clinical Manager and Charge Nurse/Supervisor conclude that 
the assignment is appropriate, the employee will accept the assignment 
and perform to the best of his/her capabilities and, if desired, file a written 
complaint as set forth in Section 6, below.  The Charge Nurse/Supervisor 
and Unit/Clinical Manager are expected to provide support and monitor 
the needs of the patients to ensure that the needs of the patients are met. 
35.3.5 
If, at any step, all parties agree that the assignment is inappropriate, it will 
be adjusted by the Charge Nurse/Supervisor in conjunction with the Unit 
or Department Manager and Clinical Manager on duty. 
35.4 
A float employee will not be required to assume the relief Charge Nurse/Supervisor role, 
unless the employee has been previously assigned and has demonstrated competency.  The 
employee acting as Relief Charge Nurse/Supervisor on a given unit will not be floated unless the 
unit is closed. 
35.5 
If staff have not floated to a unit before, the nurse will be given at least 10-15 minute 
introduction (or longer if, in the judgment of the Charge Nurse/Supervisor, more time is needed) 
to the physical environment, routine, and charting requirements for that unit by the Charge 
Nurse/Supervisor or designee.  The Staffing Issues Committee will review and develop 
guidelines for the duration of orientation typically needed for staff floating between specific like 
units. 
35.6 
Any complaints by employees that this floating policy has not been complied with shall 
be reduced to writing (on the ADO Form or in narrative) immediately upon the completion of the 
shift in question (or as soon thereafter as possible) and submitted to the Charge Nurse/Supervisor 
of the unit to which the employee was floated.  Nursing Management/Management will conduct 
an appropriate investigation, which shall include a meeting with the employee and, if desired by 
the employee, the employee’s Union representative.  Nursing Management/Management will 
respond in writing to the employee and the Union, if involved, no later than five (5) weekdays 
from the date of receipt of such complaint. 
35.7 
It is specifically agreed that the procedures provided for in Section 6, as well as any other 
provisions of this Article, are subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure contained in 
Article 10 of this Agreement.  However, it is further agreed that, as it relates to this Article, the 
scope of the arbitrator shall be limited to whether or not the Hospital has complied with the 
provisions of the Article (as opposed to disputes over the resolution of issues related to 
appropriateness of assignment, patient care needs, employee competency, or other patient/care 
safety related issues). 
 
45 
35.8 
It is understood that where an employee believes that this policy has not been complied 
with, the employee shall nevertheless accept the floating assignment, perform to the best of 
his/her capabilities, and, if desired, lodge a complaint, as set forth in Section 6 above, after the 
shift has been completed.  An ultimate refusal to accept a floating assignment (except as set forth 
in the 3rd and 4th sentences in Section 1, above) shall be considered insubordination and may, in 
the discretion of the Hospital, result in termination of the employee.  Additionally, the 
assignment of the floated employee shall be as closely related to (but not to exceed) the 
competency and skill level of the employee as possible and within the guidelines established by 
the Nurse Practice Act or any other applicable law or regulation which governs any license or 
certification of an employee. 
35.9 
An employee who is required to float to a unit for which the pay grade is lower than the 
pay grade for the employee’s home unit will not have his or her rate reduced.  An employee who 
is floated to a unit for which the pay grade is higher to perform the same duties as those 
performed by other staff on that unit, will be paid at the higher rate.  Floating for “tasking” shall 
not quality for higher pay. 
35.10 If a floated employee is not needed for the entire shift in the unit to which he/she was 
floated, the employee may be returned to his or her home unit. 
35.11 “Like Units” are:

35.12 In the event of the establishment of new units, mergers of units, or changes in technology, 
software or patient populations, the Hospital may propose changes in the definition of “Like 
Units”, or additions to the list of “Like Units”.  Such proposed changes or additions will be 
communicated to the Union at least fourteen (14) days in advance.  Upon written request of the 
Union the parties shall meet and bargain over the proposed changes.  Provided, if the parties are

unable to reach agreement within 45 days of such notice, the Hospital may proceed with 
implementation of the noticed change.

ARTICLE 35 

FLOATING 
Section 1. 
Floating  
It is understood by the parties that staffing patterns are variable due to changes and fluctuations 
in acuity and census.  Such changes and fluctuations may result in employees covered by the 
Agreement floating to other units prior to the completion of their shift so that patient care 
requirements can be met.  PCTs, LPNs, Nurse Externs and HUCs will float to units as directed, 
but will not be required to perform duties for which they are not qualified.  For purposes of this 
Article, Float means temporary (no more than part of or one shift) assignment to perform duties 
for which they are competent in a unit other than an employee’s regularly assigned unit.  Other 
staff perform their work assignments throughout the Hospital as directed and are not covered by 
this Floating Article. 
Section 2. 
Orientation 
All HUCs, nurse externs and PCTs will receive orientation to the receiving unit to the physical 
environment, routine, and charting requirements, as necessary by the Charge Nurse/Supervisor or 
designee. 
Section 3. 
Conditions and Order 
When the Hospital makes a determination that floating is necessary, employees in the needed 
classification shall be floated from a given unit in the following order: 
(a) 
Solicited volunteers.  
(b) 
Agency.   
(c) 
Contract and travelers and VSPs, collectively, on a rotating basis. 
(d) 
All regular (full-time and part-time) staff with the rotation beginning at the 
bottom of the seniority roster – the list will be ongoing. 
(e) 
If preceptor is floated, while orientating an employee, both the preceptor and the 
orientee may be floated, or the preceptor may be floated and the orientee reassigned. 
(f) 
Exceptions to, or departures from, the sequence set forth in this paragraph may 
occur if, in the good faith judgment of the Hospital, the employee scheduled to float does not 
possess the skills required in the receiving unit nor has unique skills needed in the giving unit. 
 
41 

Section 4. 
Call-Offs In Unit to Which Employee Is Floated   
If a floated employee is not needed for the entire shift in the unit to which he/she was floated, the 
employee may be returned to his or her home unit or may be floated to another unit or units for 
the remainder of the shift.  The Hospital will not require an employee to float to multiple units 
during a single shift unless, in the good faith judgment of the Hospital, such floating is necessary 
for efficient patient care. 
Section 5. 
Changes  
The provision of this Article may be changed only by mutual agreement of the parties.

FLOATING 
35.1 
Floating (RN Bargaining Unit) 
It is understood by the parties that staffing patterns are variable due to changes and 
fluctuations in acuity and census.  Such changes and fluctuations may result in employees 
covered by the Agreement floating to other units prior to the completion of their shift so that 
patient care requirements can be met.  Employees will float to units as directed, but will not be 
required to perform duties for which they are not qualified.  For purposes of this Article, Float 
means a temporary (no more than part of or one (1) shift) assignment to perform duties for which 
they are competent in a unit other than an employee’s regularly assigned unit. 
 
42 


35.1.1 Training and New Nurses.  Newly hired experienced nurses will not be required 
to float to another unit in the first three (3) months of employment.  Newly 
graduated RN’s will not be floated (for full assignment nor tasking) for six 
months. Scheduled floating may occur for training purposes. 
35.1.2 Orientation.  When floated, all nurses will receive orientation to the receiving unit 
to the physical environment, routine, and charting requirements, as necessary, by 
the Charge Nurse/Supervisor or designee. 
35.1.3 Conditions and Order.  When the Hospital makes a determination that floating 
(for reasons other than training or orientation) is necessary, employees shall be 
floated from a given unit in the following order: 
35.1.3.1 Solicited volunteers 
35.1.3.2 Agency.  All agency contracts will continue to require floating. 
35.1.3.3 Contract and travelers.  All contract and traveler contracts will continue 
to require floating, on a rotating basis. 
35.1.3.4 VSPs on a rotational basis. 
35.1.3.5 All regular (full-time and part-time) staff with the rotation beginning at 
the bottom of the seniority roster – the list will be ongoing. 
35.1.3.6 If a preceptor is floated, while orientating an employee, both the 
preceptor and the orientee may be floated, or the preceptor may be 
floated and orientee reassigned. 
35.1.3.7 Exceptions to, or departures from, the sequence set forth in this 
paragraph may occur, if, in the good faith judgment of the Hospital, the 
employee scheduled to float does not possess the skills required in the 
receiving unit or has unique skills needed in the giving unit. 
35.1.4 Differential by Location.  A critical care RN who is required to float to a non-
critical care unit shall continue to receive his or her pay rate and normal shift 
differential while in the float assignment.  If a non-critical care RN floats to a 
critical care unit, the employee shall receive a 5% differential for hours worked in 
the critical care unit.  Provided, this differential will not apply in the event that an 
employee is floated for tasking or for the purpose of caring for patients that are 
being held in a critical care unit pending assignment to a non-critical care unit. 
35.1.5 Call-offs in unit to which employee is Floated:  If a floated employee is not 
needed for the entire shift in the unit to which he/she was floated, the employee 
may be returned to his or her home unit or may be floated to another unit or units 
for the remainder of the shift.  The Hospital will not require an employee to float 
 
43 

to multiple units during a single shift unless, in the good faith judgment of the 
Hospital, such floating is necessary for efficient patient care. 
35.1.6 Call Back.  An employee who is on call (stand-by) and receiving call pay shall not 
be required to float to another unit during a call back.  When an employee is on 
call and is called in to work on a shift that falls between two of his/her 
consecutive workdays, the employee will not be required to float to another unit 
on the shift following the call back, provided the employee advises the Charge 
Nurse/Supervisor of having worked the callback on the prior day at the time 
he/she is asked to float.  
35.1.7 Extra Shift.  If a full-time or part-time employee is to work a scheduled overtime 
or extra shift, the employee will be, upon request, informed of whether the 
employee will be required to float, and if required to float, the employee may 
decline to work the overtime or extra shift.  
35.1.8 Changes.  The provision of this Article may be changed only by mutual 
agreement of the parties.

**  The Hospital will not assign more than four (4) patients to floated ICU nurses 
so long as patient care is not negatively impacted. 
35.1.10  Floating for Tasking.   For purposes of floating for tasking, all nurses may be 
floated outside of the units set forth in Section 9, with tasking defined as follows: 
performing all tasks within the scope of the nurse’s license except for tasks that 
require specialized skills or age competencies. A nurse who is floated to task will 
not be given a full assignment and will not be assigned his/her own patients.  
Tasking will include tasks for which the nurse is competent.  A nurse is expected 
to advise the Charge Nurse/Supervisor if the nurse is not competent to perform a 
specific assigned task and should not perform that specific task until she is 
competent to do so.  This does not apply to patient assignments in general.  
35.1.11  Voluntary Float Pools.  Within six months of the ratification of this contract, the 
parties will establish a committee of 3 representatives of the Union and 3 
representatives of the Hospital, to examine the feasibility of establishing a float 
pool which would reduce the need to involuntarily float staff.  Said committee 
will also attempt to establish guidelines for what orientation will be provided for 
nurses floating outside their home units.  If the committee is unable to reach 
agreement on such orientation standards after 60 days, the issue will be referred to 
the Labor/Management/Patient Care Committee.  
35.1.12  Quality Care & RN’s.  The RN is always responsible for providing safe, 
competent nursing care.  Therefore before an RN accepts a full patient 
assignment, the RN must have the necessary knowledge, judgment, skills and 
ability to provide the required care. It is the RN’s responsibility to determine 
whether s/he is clinically competent to perform the nursing care required on the 
non-home unit.  Any concerns the RN has regarding competency regarding all or 
part of an assignment should be voiced at the time of the assignment.  The RN 
 
46 

may be given a patient assignment that may include a task that he or she is not 
competent to perform, provided provision is made for that task to be performed by 
an RN or other healthcare provider who is competent to perform the task.  
Disputes over the competency of an RN to perform an assignment shall not be 
subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure. 
35.2. Floating (Service & Maintenance Bargaining Unit) 

PCT and HUC Floating 
It is understood by the parties that staffing patterns are variable due to changes and 
fluctuations in acuity and census.  Such changes and fluctuations may result in employees 
covered by the Agreement floating to other units prior to the completion of their shift so that 
patient care requirements can be met.  PCTs and HUCs will float to units as directed, but will not 
be required to perform duties for which they are not qualified.  For purposes of this Article, Float 
means a temporary (no more than part of or one (1) shift) assignment to perform duties for which 
they are competent in a unit other than an employee’s regularly assigned unit.  Other staff 
perform their work assignments throughout the Hospital as directed and are not covered by this 
Floating Article.  
35.1.13  Orientation.  All HUCs and PCTs will receive orientation to the receiving unit to 
the physical environment, routine, and charting requirements, as necessary, by the 
Charge Nurse/Supervisor or designee.  
35.1.14  Conditions and Order.  When the Hospital makes a determination that floating is 
necessary, employees in the needed classification shall be floated from a given 
unit in the following order: 
35.1.14.1 Solicited volunteers 
35.1.14.2 Agency. All agency contracts will continue to require floating. 
35.1.14.3 Contract and travelers and VSPs, collectively, on a rotating basis. All 
contract and traveler contracts will continue to require floating, on a 
rotating basis. 
35.1.14.4 All regular (full-time and part-time) staff with the rotation beginning at 
the bottom of the seniority roster - the list will be ongoing. 
35.1.14.5 If preceptor is floated, while orientating an employee, both the 
preceptor and the orientee may be floated, or the preceptor may be 
floated and the orientee reassigned. 
35.1.14.6 Exceptions to, or departures from, the sequence set forth in this 
paragraph may occur, if, in the good faith judgment of the Hospital, the 
employee scheduled to float does not possess the skills required in the 
receiving unit nor has unique skills needed in the giving unit. 
 
47 

35.1.15  Call-offs in unit to which employee is Floated: If a floated employee is not 
needed for the entire shift in the unit to which he/she was floated, the employee 
may be returned to his or her home unit or may be floated to another unit or units 
for the remainder of the shift.  The Hospital will not require an employee to float 
to multiple units during a single shift unless, in the good faith judgment of the 
Hospital, such floating is necessary for efficient patient care.  
35.1.16  Changes.  The provision of this Article may be changed only by mutual 
agreement of the parties.
