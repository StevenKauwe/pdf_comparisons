ARTICLE 10 

GRIEVANCE AND ARBITRATION 
10.1 Definition of Grievance that is Subject to Arbitration. 
A grievance subject to arbitration is a dispute or disagreement involving the 
interpretation, application or compliance with specific provisions of this Agreement or a dispute 
or disagreement concerning whether or not discipline including discharge was for just cause.  
The Union may file a grievance on behalf of one or more bargaining unit members. 
10.2 Time Limits, Representation and Witnesses. 
All grievances must be presented at the proper steps in accordance with the time 
limitations noted at the various Steps.  Failure to adhere to these time limitations shall render the 
grievance null and void and it may not be pursued further, however, failure of Management to 
respond in a timely manner will not bar the grievance from being presented at the next step of the 
procedure.  Employees may be represented by a Union Steward and/or a Field Representative at 
any step of the grievance procedure.  Witnesses for either party may attend a grievance meeting, 
so long as direct presentation of the witness(s)’ information or testimony at the meeting is 
deemed relevant and necessary by agreement of the parties.  All time limits in this Article 
exclude weekends and holidays and may be extended by written mutual agreement of the parties. 
10.3 Grievance Procedure. 
10.3.1 
Step 1.A grievance shall be filed in writing with the Director of Labor 
Relations or his or her designee within fifteen (15) days of the date of the 
event giving rise to the grievance or of the earliest date the grievant, the 
Union, or a Union Steward knows or should have known of the facts 
giving rise to the grievance.  The grievance shall be submitted on the 
Grievance Form set out in Appendix E.  Failure to include all information 
called for on the form will not preclude consideration of the grievance.  
However, if the Hospital believes there has been a failure to provide the 
information called for in the form, it shall promptly notify the Union in 
writing of this lack of information and processing of the grievance will be 
suspended until the form is properly completed and resubmitted.  Any 
monetary liability shall be suspended from the time of notification until 
such time as the information called for in the form is provided to the 
Hospital in writing.  The Hospital and the Union will conduct a meeting 
 
13 
between the grievant and the employee’s Department Manager/Director or 
designee and/or the Director of Labor Relations or his or her designee and 
a Shop Steward and/or Field Representative within ten (10) days.  A 
written response to the grievance will be provided to the Union Steward 
within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the Step I grievance with copies to 
the grievant and the Field Representative.  Nothing in this Section 10.3.1 
precludes the employee from discussing and/or resolving an issue 
informally with management before filing a grievance. 
10.3.2 
Step 2. If the grievance is not resolved at Step I and the Union wishes to 
advance the grievance, the Union must request in writing that the 
grievance be moved to Step 2 by submitting such request to the Director 
of Labor Relations or his or her designee within fifteen (15) days from the 
date the Step 1 response was received by the Union Steward. Within 
fifteen (15) days of receipt of the appeal to Step 2, the Hospital and the 
Union will conduct a meeting between the grievant, the Shop Steward 
and/or Field Representative, and the appropriate member of the Senior 
Management Team, the Director of Labor Relations or his or her designee, 
and any other members of management desired by the Hospital, to hear 
the grievance.  The COO (or designee) or Chief Nursing Officer (or 
designee) (as appropriate) will respond to the grievance in writing to the 
Field Representative within fifteen (15) days after the Step 2 meeting. 
10.3.3 
Step 3 - Arbitration.  If the grievance is not resolved on the basis of the 
Step 2 response, then within thirty (30) days from the date the Step 2 
response was received by the Field Representative the grievance may be 
appealed to arbitration by the Union notifying the Director of Labor 
Relations or his or her designee for the involved Hospital in writing of its 
intention to arbitrate the dispute.  At the same time, the Union shall 
request within seven (7) days of such notification, that the Federal 
Mediation and Conciliation Service submit to each of the parties a panel of 
seven (7) arbitrators having hospital arbitration experience.  The arbitrator 
shall be selected by each party alternately striking names until only one (1) 
remains.  Either party may reject one (1) panel in its entirety.  To 
determine which party strikes the first name, the parties shall flip a coin. 
Management shall respond to a Union request to strike a panel within ten 
(10) calendar days of receipt of a written request to do so, communicated 
directly to the Director of Labor Relations or his or her designee, provided 
that the Hospital has had the panel for at least fourteen (14) calendar days. 
10.3.4 
Voluntary Mediation.  Within seven (7) calendar days of the Union’s 
appeal to arbitration the Union may request the Employer to 
participate in mediation.  If the Employer agrees, the parties shall 
request the appointment of a mediator from the Federal Mediation 
and Conciliation Service.  In no event will such mediation delay or 
alter the scheduling or conducting of the arbitration hearing. 
 
14 
10.3.5 
During the grievance procedure, either party may request the other party to 
produce evidence relevant to the grievance that is within the party’s 
possession or control.  If either party requests the production of evidence 
requiring review and/or copying of numerous documents, (other than 
documents from an employee’s personnel file covered by Article 12 
Personnel Files), the party reviewing or copying such documents may 
charge the requesting party reasonable clerical and copying expenses.  The 
arbitrator will not consider any evidence from a party which failed to 
produce such evidence in support of that party’s position during Steps 1 or 
2 of the grievance procedure in response to a reasonably specific written 
request for production of such evidence. 
10.3.6 
Limits on the Arbitrator.  The arbitrator shall have no power to: add to or 
subtract from, or to modify any of the terms of this Agreement or to 
arbitrate any matter after this Agreement has expired other than matters 
which arose prior to the time of expiration of the Agreement.  As to 
matters involving the merits of the case, the parties will jointly request that 
the arbitrator issue his decision within thirty (30) days of the arbitrator’s 
receipt of the parties post hearing briefs.  The parties will notify the 
arbitrator of this request at the time of selection of the dates for the 
arbitration hearing.  Fees and expenses of the arbitrator and reporter, if 
any, and expenses of the facilities at which the hearing is held shall be 
shared equally by the parties.  However, each party shall bear its own 
expenses of representation and witnesses.

GRIEVANCE AND ARBITRATION 
Section 1. 
Definition 
(a) 
A “grievance” is a written complaint, submitted on an Appendix C form, by an 
employee or the Union against the Hospital for a breach of a specific provision of this 
Agreement, except as to those provisions which are not subject to this Article. 
 
12 

(b) 
An aggrieved employee may request a steward and/or business representative at 
any step of this process subject to the notice requirements contained herein.  The Hospital may 
require that the aggrieved employee bring a Union steward or business representative with him 
or her at any step of this process. 
Section 2. 
Procedure 
The parties agree to the following pre-grievance step which is for the purpose of promoting a 
problem-solving atmosphere at the Hospital: 
(a) 
Informal Resolution with Immediate Supervisor  
Employees with a dispute must first discuss their concerns with their immediate supervisor and 
attempt to resolve the dispute prior to filing a written grievance.  Failure to do so will render the 
grievance null and void.  Employees shall have the right to have a steward or Union 
representative present at such meetings at the employee’s request. 
(b) 
Step 1  
(1) 
An employee (or his/her Union steward) may initiate a grievance by 
submitting it in writing to the Director of Labor Relations or his or her designee within fourteen 
(14) days (in this Article “days” means calendar days) of the date of the event giving rise to the 
grievance, or of the earliest date the grievant, the Union or a Union steward knows, or should 
have known, of the facts giving rise to the grievance. 
(2) 
The Step 1 grievance shall be submitted on the Grievance Form set out in 
Appendix C.  Failure to include all information called for on the form will not preclude 
consideration of the grievance.  However, if the Hospital believes there has been a failure to 
provide the information called for in the form, it shall promptly notify the Union in writing of 
this lack of information and processing of the grievance will be suspended until the form is 
properly completed and resubmitted.  Any monetary liability shall be suspended from the time of 
notification until such time as the information called for in the form is provided to the Hospital in 
writing. 
(3) 
Filing is effective upon personal delivery to the Director of Labor 
Relations or his or her designee, or upon receipt by him/her if sent by fax or e-mail.  Grievances 
sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, addressed to the Director of Labor Relations or 
his or her designee will be considered to have been filed upon dispatch. 
(4) 
The Director of Labor Relations or his or her designee will refer the 
grievance to the appropriate level of supervision (Director/Manager/Supervisor/Charge Nurse) 
for response at Step 1. 
(5) 
A Step 1 meeting shall be held between the grievant, the Union steward (if 
requested), a staff representative of the Union (if requested) and the 
Director/Manager/Supervisor/Charge Nurse (or his/her designee), and (if desired by the 
Hospital), any subordinate members of supervision and Director of Labor Relations or his or her 
 
13 

designee within seven (7) days of receipt of the grievance by the Director of Human Resources 
(or designee). 
(6) 
Within seven (7) days of the meeting, the Hospital shall provide a written 
response to the grievant. 
(c) 
Step 2 
(1) 
If not resolved at Step 1, the Union must request a Step 2 meeting, in 
writing to the Director of Labor Relations or his or her designee within seven (7) days of receipt 
of the Hospital’s Step 1 response. 
(2) 
A Step 2 meeting shall be held between the grievant, the steward, the 
Union’s Staff Representative (if desired by the Union), the Department Director, and (if desired 
by the Hospital) the Director of Labor Relations or his or her designee within seven (7) days of 
receipt of the Step 2 grievance.  If the Department Director heard the grievance at First Step, the 
Second Step will be heard by the Director of Labor Relations or his or her designee.  
(3) 
Within seven (7) days of the meeting, the Step 2 management 
representative shall provide a written response to the grievant. 
(d) 
Step 3  
(1) 
If the grievance is not satisfactorily resolved on the basis of the Step 2 
response, and the Union wishes to advance the grievance, it must do so by appealing the 
grievance at Step 3 to the Hospital’s Chief Operating Officer/Chief Nursing Officer/Chief 
Financial Officer within seven (7) days of receipt of the Step 2 response or within seven (7) days 
of the expiration of time for holding the Step 2 meeting if no meeting is held, by filing the appeal 
in writing with the Hospital’s Director of Labor Relations or his or her designee. 
(2) 
A meeting between the grievant, the Union steward, the Union’s Staff 
Representative (if desired by the Union), and the Chief Operating Officer/Chief Nursing 
Officer/Chief Financial Officer and (if desired by the Hospital), any subordinate member of 
management and the  Director of Labor Relations or his or her designee, will be held to discuss 
the grievance within fourteen (14) days after the Hospital’s receipt of the Step 3 grievance. 
(3) 
The Hospital shall furnish the Union with a written answer to the Step 3 
grievance by certified mail, return receipt requested, postmarked within fourteen (14) calendar 
days after the Step 3 meeting. 
Section 3. 
Multi-Grievant Issues 
(a) 
The Union may file one grievance on behalf of multiple grievants involving the 
same issue of contract interpretation.  Such grievances must be filed with the Director of Labor 
Relations or his or her designee within the time for filing a Step 1 grievance, clearly identifying 
the class of grievants on whose behalf the grievance is filed and containing the information 
(other than each specific grievant’s name, work location and home address) set forth on the 
grievance form set forth in Appendix C. 
 
14 

(b) 
A meeting between the Director of Labor Relations or his or her designee, any 
other Hospital representatives desired by the Hospital, and the chief Union steward and Union 
Staff Representative will be held within fourteen (14) days from the date of filing of the 
grievance, in an attempt to resolve the matter. 
(c) 
The Director of Labor Relations or his or her designee shall respond in writing to 
the grievance within fourteen (14) days of the meeting.  Appeal from this response will be the 
same as appeal from a Step 3 response. 
Section 4. 
Time Limits 
(a) 
All time limits set forth in this Article are of the essence and may be extended 
only by specific written mutual agreement in a single document signed by the Hospital and 
Union. 
(b) 
Untimely grievances filed at Step 1 shall be barred, and grievances not advanced 
in strict accordance with the foregoing procedures or time limits will be considered as resolved 
on the basis of the Hospital’s last answer. 
(c) 
If the Hospital fails to set a meeting or provide a timely response, the Union may 
advance the grievance to the next step, and must do so if it wishes to keep the grievance viable. 
Section 5. 
Arbitration 
(a) 
In the event the grievance has not been resolved by the procedure described 
above, if the Union wishes to advance the grievance to arbitration, the Union may do so by 
requesting, within ten (10) days of receipt of the Step 3 response, that the Federal Mediation and 
Conciliation Service (FMCS) submit a geographically unrestricted panel of seven arbitrators.  A 
copy of such request along with a demand for arbitration must be mailed or faxed to the 
Hospital’s Director of Labor Relations or his or her designee on the same day as the request for a 
panel is sent to the FMCS.  Upon receipt of the panel of arbitrators, the Union shall contact the 
Hospital within fourteen (14) days and initiate selection of the arbitrator, who shall be selected 
by each party alternately striking names until only one remains.  Either party may reject one 
panel in its entirety.  Should either party exercise this option, it shall be accomplished by 
notifying the FMCS in writing with a copy to the other party with the rejecting party 
simultaneously requesting of the FMCS the submission to the parties an additional or 
replacement panel.  To determine which party strikes the first name, the parties shall flip a coin. 
(b) 
Within seven (7) calendar days of the Union’s appeal to arbitration the Union may 
request the Employer to participate in mediation.  If the Employer agrees, the parties shall 
request the appointment of a mediator from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service.  In 
no event will such mediation delay or alter the scheduling or conducting of the arbitration 
hearing. 
(c) 
During the grievance procedure, either party may request the other party to 
produce evidence relevant to the grievance that is within the party’s possession or control.  If 
either party requests the production of evidence requiring review and / or copying of numerous 
documents, the party reviewing or copying such documents may charge the requesting party 
 
15 

reasonable clerical and copying expenses.  The arbitrator will not consider any evidence from a 
party which failed to produce such evidence in support of that party’s position during Steps 1 
through 3 of the grievance procedure in response to a reasonably specific written request for 
production of such evidence.   
(d) 
If there is an issue as to whether a grievance is barred for failure of the Union or 
grievant to comply with the procedural requirements of this Article (procedural arbitrability), the 
arbitrator shall have only the authority to address that question.  No arbitrator may hear or decide 
both the merits and the issue of arbitrability unless both parties specifically agree to such a 
submission in a single writing.  Provided, in cases involving discharge, the same arbitrator will 
be permitted to rule on both the question of procedural arbitrability and the merits, but will be 
required to issue a bench ruling on the issue of arbitrability immediately upon the close of 
evidence on the issue of arbitrability and before hearing evidence on the merits.  Issues of 
substantive arbitrability are to be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction. 
(e) 
The arbitrator shall have no power to: (1) add to or subtract from, or modify any 
of the terms of this Agreement; (2) to establish or change any wage scale or any other 
compensation formula; (3) hear or decide any dispute as to the number or classifications of 
employees needed, at any given time, to provide patient care for the Hospital’s patients or to 
perform Hospital services; (4) award back pay for any period more than fourteen (14) days prior 
to the filing of the grievance; or, (5) arbitrate any matter after this Agreement has expired other 
than matters which arose prior to the time of expiration of the Agreement. 
(f) 
If either party so desires, a court reporter may be used for arbitration hearings, the 
cost of which shall be borne solely by the party requesting the service.  If both parties agree to 
the use of a court reporter, the fees and expenses of the Court Reporter shall be shared equally.  
Neither party will request access to the original transcript if that party did not agree to share the 
cost of the court reporter at the outset of the hearing. 
(g) 
The fees and expenses of the arbitrator and the expense of the facilities at which 
the hearing is held shall be borne equally by the parties.  Each party shall bear the expense of 
preparing and presenting its own case. 
The decision of the arbitrator shall be in writing setting forth both the arbitrator’s ruling and the 
reasons for the ruling.  As to matters involving the merits of the case, the parties will jointly 
request that the arbitrator issue his decision within thirty (30) days of the arbitrator’s receipt of 
the parties’ post-hearing briefs.  The parties will notify the arbitrator of this request at the time of 
the selection of dates for the arbitration hearing.  The arbitrator’s decision, if rendered within the 
scope of his/her authority, shall be final and binding on all parties, subject to vacation only as 
provided by state and federal law.

only one (1) remains. Either party may reject one (1) panel in its entirety. Should 
either party exercise this option, it shall be accomplished by notifying the FMCS

scheduling or conducting of the arbitration hearing. 
10.5.3 During the grievance procedure, either party may request the other party to 
produce evidence relevant to the grievance that is within the party’s possession or 
control.  If either party requests the production of evidence requiring review and / 
or copying of numerous documents, the party reviewing or copying such 
documents may charge the requesting party reasonable clerical and copying 
expenses.  The arbitrator will not consider any evidence from a party which failed 
to produce such evidence in support of that party’s position during Steps 1 
through 3 of the grievance procedure in response to a reasonably specific written 
request for production of such evidence.  
 
16 

10.5.4 If there is an issue as to whether a grievance is barred for failure of the Union or 
grievant to comply with the procedural requirements of this Article (procedural 
arbitrability), the arbitrator shall have only the authority to address that question.  
No arbitrator may hear or decide both the merits and the issue of arbitrability 
unless both parties specifically agree to such a submission in a single writing.  
Provided, in cases involving discharge, the same arbitrator will be permitted to 
rule on both the question of procedural arbitrability and the merits, but will be 
required to issue a bench ruling on the issue of arbitrability immediately upon the 
close of evidence on the issue of arbitrability and before hearing evidence on the 
merits.  Issues of substantive arbitrability are to be decided by a court of 
competent jurisdiction.  
10.5.5 The arbitrator shall have no power to: (1) add to or subtract from, or modify any 
of the terms of this Agreement; (2) to establish or change any wage scale or any 
other compensation formula; (3) hear or decide any dispute as to the number or 
classifications of employees needed, at any given time, to provide patient care for 
the Hospital’s patients or to perform Hospital services; (4) award back pay for any 
period more than fourteen (14) days prior to the filing of the grievance; or, (5) 
arbitrate any matter after this Agreement has expired other than matters which 
arose prior to the time of expiration of the Agreement.  
10.5.6 If either party so desires, a court reporter may be used for arbitration hearings, the 
cost of which shall be borne solely by the party requesting the service. If both 
parties agree to the use of a court reporter, the fees and expenses of the Court 
Reporter shall be shared equally.  Neither party will request access to the original 
transcript if that party did not agree to share the cost of the court reporter at the 
outset of the hearing.  
10.5.7 The fees and expenses of the arbitrator and the expense of the facilities at which 
the hearing is held shall be borne equally by the parties.  Each party shall bear the 
expense of preparing and presenting its own case.  
10.5.8 The decision of the arbitrator shall be in writing setting forth both the arbitrator’s 
ruling and the reasons for the ruling.  As to matters involving the merits of the 
case, the parties will jointly request that the arbitrator issue his decision within 
thirty (30) days of the arbitrator’s receipt of the parties’ post-hearing briefs.  The 
parties will notify the arbitrator of this request at the time of the selection of dates
