CALL OFF PROCEDURE 
18.1 
Call Off Decisions: 
18.1.1 
The Hospital’s staffing patterns are variable.  Fluctuations may result in 
employees covered by this Agreement being asked to delay their report 
time, being sent home from work prior to completion of their shift, or the 
cancellation of a shift that has been scheduled, hereinafter referred to as 
“Called Off”.  While the parties recognize that such variability is 
unavoidable, the Hospital will make every reasonable effort to avoid call-
offs. 
 
26 
18.1.2 
Disputes arising under Section 18.1.1 (including those relating to the need 
for any call-off and/or whether the Hospital has made reasonable efforts to 
avoid call-offs) shall not be subject to the grievance and arbitration 
procedure of this Agreement. However, either party may, within ten (10) 
days of any call-off, request the assistance of a mediator from the FMCS 
or other mutually agreed upon neutral third party to assist the parties in 
resolving the issue(s). 
18.2 
Call Off Mechanics 
18.2.1 
If an employee is asked to delay his/her report time, he/she will not be 
called off for the remainder of the shift unless the employee goes on-call 
when told to delay his/her report time. 
18.2.2 
When the Hospital makes a determination that a Call Off is necessary, the 
Call Off shall apply to the classifications affected in the unit and shift in 
which the call-off is taking place in the following order, by seniority, so 
long as the remaining employees are fully competent to care for the 
Hospital’s actual or anticipated patients or perform the services needed: 
1. 
Agency Employees and Travelers and, at the Hospital’s discretion, VSP 
employees who are scheduled for or who have worked 30 or more hours in 
that week. 
2. 
Employees on any type of premium pay except those who are not working 
their regularly scheduled shift (not including premiums that apply to all 
employees on the given shift, such as holiday payor shift differentials). 
3. 
Per Diem employees (the manager may choose to solicit volunteers before 
calling off per diem employees on any given day). 
4. 
Solicited volunteers (the manager may choose to solicit volunteers at any 
earlier step of the call-off procedure). 
5. 
Part-time employees working an extra shift at straight-time rates. 
6. 
All other employees. 
18.3 
Employees Called Back from Call Off.  Employees called back from call-off will be 
called in the reverse order of the above. 
18.4 
Use of Unpaid Time or PTO for Call-Off.  A full-time or part-time employee who is 
called off may use voluntary unpaid leave or Paid Time Off at the employee’s discretion. 
18.5 
Floating Before Calling Off / Orientation.  The Hospital will float full-time or part-
time nursing assistants and unit clerks to other units before implementing the call-off procedure 
in the units from which they are floated in order to reduce the need for overtime or the impact of 
 
27 
call offs on full-time and part-time employees.  The Hospital will provide training and/or 
orientation to the other units for nursing assistants or unit secretaries desiring such work. 
18.6 
Maintaining Contact.  Once an employee is called off, such employee shall not be 
required to maintain contact and availability with the facility for the remainder of the shift.  This 
does not preclude the employee from volunteering to be placed on call.

Order of Call Off 
The Hospital’s staffing patterns are variable due to fluctuations in census or procedures or the 
need to reduce expenses.  Such fluctuations may result in employees covered by this Agreement 
being sent home from work prior to the completion of their shift or the cancellation of a shift that 
has been scheduled, hereinafter referred to as “Called Off.”  Floating of staff to minimize 
 
25 

premium pay may take place before initiating the following Call Off procedure.  When the 
Hospital makes a determination that a Call Off is necessary in a given department and shift, then

following order, so long as the remaining employees are fully competent to perform the work 
and/or care for the Hospital’s actual or anticipated patients: 
(a) 
Agency employees and Travelers (except travelers or agency employees whom 
the Hospital is contractually obligated to pay for the shift) and, at the Hospital’s discretion, VSP 
employees who are scheduled for or who have worked 30 or more hours in that week.  However, 
it is understood that the Hospital will call a traveler or agency employee off, if the charge nurse 
or manager (or designee) initiating the call-off is able to determine, at the time of the call-off that 
the Hospital can meet its contractual obligation by offering an available alternate shift to the 
agency or traveler. 
(b) 
On-call employees who are working (in reverse seniority). 
(c) 
VSP employees on overtime (selection at Hospital’s option). 
(d) 
Full-time or part-time employees on premium pay (in reverse seniority). 
(e) 
Full-time and part-time employees in the department who have previously 
indicated a desire to be called off on the shift per the department practice. 
(f) 
Full-time and part-time employees in departments to which floating may 
eliminate the need for a call-off, who have previously indicated a desire to be called off on the 
shift per the departmental practice (full-shift calls only). 
(g) 
VSP employees in the department or in other departments to which floating may 
eliminate the need for a call-off (selection at Hospital’s option) (outside the department being 
reduced only in the case of a full-shift call-off). 
(h) 
All other employees (except travelers or agency as referenced in #1 above) in the 
affected department rotated in such a manner that the time lost is equitably distributed within the 
department.  The rotation shall start by reverse seniority in the department. 
(i) 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a manager may choose to ask for volunteers first. 
Section 2. 
Use of PTO 
If an employee is scheduled to work and no work is available and the employee is called off, the 
employee may use voluntary unpaid leave or Paid Time Off at the employee’s discretion. 
Section 3. 
Pay for Travel 
In the event an employee reports to work (without prior notification of being Called Off) and is 
sent home before beginning work, such employee will be paid two (2) hours base pay to 
compensate him/her for travel to and from the Hospital. 
 
26 

Section 4. 
Employees Called Back from Call Off. 
Employees called back from call off will be called in the reverse order of the above.  Employees 
called off shall have the right to decline to be subject to recall.
