changes are made in the HCA 401(k) Plan, the Life Insurance and the Long Term Disability 
Insurance plan, the Medical and Vision and Day Care Spending Accounts, or in the HCA Smart 
Care PPO, or if changes in the Aetna - POS are imposed by the plan provider, which result in

least 60 days notice of such changes, and will, upon written request received within thirty (30)

(85%) of the cost of individual plus dependent coverage (based on premiums or premium 
equivalents) for medical coverage under the Aetna POS for part-time employees with less than 
three (3) years of service and 90% of the cost of individual coverage and eighty-five (85%) of 
the cost of individual plus dependent coverage under the HCA Smart Care Base PPO. 
The Hospital will continue to pay the full cost of the existing Life & AD&D benefit, 
through the term of this agreement.  The Hospital will also continue the existing employee 
discount for hospital services at Hospital.
