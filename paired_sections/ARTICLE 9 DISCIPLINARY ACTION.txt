ARTICLE 9 

DISCIPLINARY ACTION 
The Hospital may suspend, discharge or otherwise discipline an employee for just cause.  
The Hospital in its discretion may utilize progressive discipline, including written warnings, final 
written warnings and suspensions. 
Employees may have a Union Steward present when they are questioned by management 
concerning a matter which the employee reasonable believes may result in his or her discipline, 
and in the event that the employee is being issued discipline.  If the Union Steward of 
employee’s choice cannot be made immediately available at the time of the meeting due to 
operational needs, the employee will be given up to an hour to identify an alternate steward who 
is available.  If an available alternate steward has not been identified within an hour, an 
investigatory meeting may proceed without further delay if circumstances are such that there is 
an immediate need to proceed with the investigation.  So long as an employee receives at least 
two (2) hours’ notice of the need for a meeting to administer discipline, the meeting will not be 
delayed beyond the end of the shift due to the unavailability of a steward. 
Any written warning, suspension or other discipline of a non-probationary employee will 
be subject to the grievance and arbitration provisions of this Agreement.  Coaching sessions, 
documented or otherwise, are not considered discipline and therefore are not grievable.  A 
Coaching Session will be grievable as part of any grievance over a higher level of discipline 
issued for the same or similar conduct. 
The arbitrator shall have no authority to modify or alter the discipline or penalty imposed 
by the Hospital unless it is established by a preponderance of evidence that there was not just 
cause for the discipline.  In no event may the arbitrator simply substitute his/her judgment for 
that of the Hospital. 
Disciplinary actions may be considered in determining the appropriateness of progressive 
discipline for a period of twelve (12) months from the date of discipline.  However, final written 
warnings and unpaid suspensions may be used as the basis for further discipline for a period of 
two (2) years in the event of a recurrence of conduct reasonably similar to that for which the final 
written warning was issued.  Further, prior incidents of sexual harassment or harassment 
forbidden by law, which do not lead to termination, may be considered in connection with 
determining discipline for any subsequent similar conduct without limitation.  Coaching 
 
12 
sessions, documented or otherwise, and disciplinary actions that are “expired” as described 
above may be used to establish an employee’s knowledge of rules, policies, or expectations. 
If the discipline is overturned through arbitration, or is otherwise conceded by the 
Hospital to have been issued without just cause, the employee’s personnel file will be purged of 
all references to such discipline.
