0-4 Years – 60% of Base Rate 
5-9 Years – 80% of Base Rate 
10+ Years – 100% of Base Rate 
Compliance to FMLA certification will be required to support a request for payment.  Based on 
the FMLA certification, employees may be paid up to two weeks time off based on their HRIS 
Norm Hours, not to exceed eighty (80) hours per calendar year, Family Illness Pay may be used 
in increments for varying events; however the one week waiting period will be applied to each 
event, and prior to accessing Family Illness Pay.

time off will be deducted from the employee’s PTO balance.  If the employee does not have 
sufficient PTO to cover the extended time off, the time will be unpaid.
