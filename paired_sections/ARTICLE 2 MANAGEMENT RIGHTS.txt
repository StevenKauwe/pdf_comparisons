MANAGEMENT RIGHTS 
2.1 
Except as modified, delegated or granted in this Agreement, the Hospital retains the 
exclusive right to manage the operations of the Hospital and to direct its working forces.  Among 
those exclusive rights, but not limited thereto is the right to hire, transfer, promote, discipline, 
suspend or discharge for just cause; assign and supervise employees; to determine and change 
starting times, quitting times and shifts, and the number of hours to be worked; to determine 
staffing patterns, to install security devices for the protection of persons and property, to 
determine policies and procedures with respect to patient care; to determine or change the 
methods and means by which its operations are to be carried on; to carry out all ordinary 
functions of management; provided, however, that such rights shall not be enforced contrary to 
the provision of this Agreement. 
2.2 
The parties agree that, except to the extent this Agreement specifically provides 
otherwise, the Hospital will have no duty to bargain with the Union over actions of the Hospital, 
 
3 
not prohibited by this Agreement, which have some effect on bargaining unit employees, unless 
such actions directly affect the job security of bargaining unit members.  In the event the 
Hospital does take some action, not prohibited by this Agreement, which directly affects the job 
security of bargaining unit members, or if the Hospital intends to install security devices, the 
Hospital will, upon request, bargain with the union about whether such action will be taken over 
a period not to exceed thirty (30) days from the date the Union was notified of the proposed 
action or became aware of the proposed action.  If the parties are unable to resolve the matter 
through bargaining during such thirty (30) day period, the Hospital shall have the right to move 
forward with its action without further bargaining. 
Nothing in Section 2.2 is intended to create any additional bargaining obligation which 
would not otherwise exist under other provisions of this Agreement.

MANAGEMENT RIGHTS 
Section 1. 
In General 
Except as specifically and clearly abridged by express provisions of this Agreement, nothing in 
this Agreement shall be construed to limit or impair the right of the Hospital to exercise its 
discretion in determining whom to employ, and nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted as 
interfering in any way with the Hospital’s right to determine and direct the policies, modes and 
methods of providing patient care, or the Hospital’s right to alter, rearrange or change, extend, 
limit or curtail its services or operations or any part thereof, to decide the number and 
qualifications of employees that may be assigned to any shift, unit, procedure, group of patients, 
or job, or the equipment or methods to be employed in the performance of such work, whatever 
may be the effect on employment, to utilize personnel from nursing registries or other temporary 
help agencies, to determine or redetermine job duties and the division of duties between job 
classifications, to specify or assign work requirements and overtime, or to establish and alter 
 
2 

working schedules as needed for efficient patient care, when in the sole discretion of the Hospital 
it may deem it advisable to do all or any of said things.  Thus, the Hospital reserves and retains, 
solely and exclusively, all of the rights, privileges and prerogatives which it would have in the 
absence of this Agreement, regardless of the frequency or infrequency with which such rights 
have been exercised in the past, except to the extent that such rights, privileges and prerogatives 
are specifically and clearly abridged by express provisions of this Agreement.  It is understood 
that nothing in this Agreement shall preclude supervisors or managerial personnel from 
performing the same work as is performed by employees covered by this Agreement.  The 
parties also agree that the Hospital will not establish supervisory or managerial positions for the 
purpose of reducing bargaining unit positions. 
Section 2. 
Elaboration of Rights 
In expansion rather than in limitation of the foregoing Section 1, the Hospital shall have the 
following unilateral rights: 

(a) 
To determine the number, location and types of facilities; 
(b) 
To determine the services to be performed, and the location or unit where such 
services will be performed; 
(c) 
To introduce new equipment, machinery or processes and to change or eliminate 
existing equipment, machinery or processes; and to automate processes or operations; 
(d) 
To subcontract any of the work or services for economic reasons; 
(e) 
To determine the size and composition of the work force, including the number of 
shifts required, the starting and ending times of such shifts, and the number of employees 
assigned to any particular shift or operation; 
(f) 
To select, hire, train, transfer employees, and to discipline and discharge 
employees for just cause; 
(g) 
To direct and manage the working force;  
(h) 
To hire temporary employees for designated periods of time, subject to any 
specific limitations set forth in this Agreement; 
(i) 
To determine working hours, shift assignments and days off;  
(j) 
To adopt, change or rescind any reasonable Hospital work rules; 
(k) 
To install devices for the protection of persons and property. 
Section 3. 
Intended Effect 
The parties agree that, except to the extent this Agreement specifically provides otherwise, the 
Hospital will have no duty to bargain with the Union over actions of the Hospital, not prohibited 
 
3 

by this Agreement, which have some effect on bargaining unit employees, unless such actions 
directly affect the job security of bargaining unit members.  In the event the Hospital does take 
some action, not prohibited by this Agreement, which directly affects the job security of 
bargaining unit members, or if the Hospital intends to install security devices, the Hospital will, 
upon request, bargain with the Union about whether such action will be taken over a period not 
to exceed thirty (30) days from the date the Union was notified of the proposed action or became 
aware of the proposed action.  If the parties are unable to resolve the matter through bargaining 
during such 30-day period, the Hospital shall have the right to move forward with its action 
without further bargaining. 

Nothing in Section 3 is intended to create any additional bargaining obligation which would not 
otherwise exist under other provisions of this Agreement.
