ARTICLE 44 

NO STRIKE / NO LOCKOUT 
44.1 Prohibited Activity. 
During the term of this Agreement, neither the Union nor its agents or representatives, 
nor any employee, individually or collectively, shall call, sanction, support or participate in any 
picketing (informational or otherwise), or any strike, work stoppage, sit-down, sickout or slow-
down, or any refusal to cross a picket line at, or refusal to enter, the Hospital’s premises, or any 
other interference with any of the Hospital’s services or operations, or with the movement or 
transportation of goods to the Hospital’s premises. 
44.2 
Waiver by Union. 
The prohibitions of this Article are intended to apply regardless of the motivation for the 
strike or other conduct.  By way of illustration only, this Article expressly prohibits (1) sympathy 
strikes (individual or concerted failure to cross a picket line established by another labor 
organization or by members of another bargaining unit); (2) strikes over disputes that are not 
subject to arbitration; and (3) strikes in protest of alleged violations of state or federal law.  Any 
statutory right under the National Labor Relations Act which the employee may otherwise have 
to engage in such conduct is hereby expressly waived by the Union.  Provided, nothing in the 
Article will forbid a refusal to work protected by the Occupational Safety and Health Act. 
44.3 
Penalty. 
Any employee who participates in any activity prohibited by this Article shall be subject 
to discharge or such lesser discipline as the Hospital in its discretion shall determine, provided 
however, that such employee shall have recourse to the grievance and arbitration procedure as to 
the sole question of whether he or she in fact participated in such prohibited activity. 
44.4 
Union Officials. 
In view of their leadership positions, the Local Union’s elected officers shall take 
affirmative steps in the event of a violation of this Article.  Those affirmative steps shall be to 
 
56 
notify in writing the Union members actively and currently employed by the employer engaging 
in such activity, and indicating to the member:  (1) that the action engaged in (as specifically 
outlined in Section 44.1 hereof) is a violation of the Collective Bargaining Agreement; (2) that 
such violation by the member is subject to discipline, up to and including discharge; (3) that the 
prohibited activity is not legally sanctioned by Local 1107; and, (4) that the Union is urging 
members to immediately return to work. 
44.5 No Lockouts. 
The Hospital agrees that there shall be no lockout during the term of this Agreement.  As 
use herein, the term “lockout” shall not include the closing down or curtailment of operations or 
layoffs due to economic conditions, business or operations reasons, natural disaster or reasons 
beyond the Hospital’s control. 
44.6 
Judicial Remedies. 
The Hospital or the Union shall be entitled to all appropriate judicial remedies, including 
but not limited to, injunctive relief and damages, if a violation of this Article should occur.  
Either party may immediately institute judicial proceedings to obtain such remedies, without any 
prior obligation to seek relief under the grievance and arbitration procedure of this Agreement.  
Injunctive relief shall be available to the Hospital or the Union regardless of whether the dispute 
giving rise to the conduct prohibited by this Article is subject to arbitration.  Any right to remove 
a state court action filed by the Hospital or the Union to federal court alleging a violation of this 
Article is expressly waived by the Hospital and the Union.
