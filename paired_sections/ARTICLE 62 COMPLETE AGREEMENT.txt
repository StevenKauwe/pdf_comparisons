COMPLETE AGREEMENT 
It is acknowledged and agreed that during the course of negotiations preceding the execution of 
this Agreement, matters and issues of interest to the Union, the employees and to the Hospital 
pertaining to wages, hours and conditions of employment have been fully considered and 
negotiated, that each party was afforded the unrestricted right to pursue and discuss proposals 
pertaining to wages, hours and conditions of employment and that the understanding and 
agreements arrived at by the parties during the course of said negotiations are fully set forth in 
this Agreement.  This Agreement supersedes and cancels all prior practices and agreements, 
whether written or oral, unless expressly stated to the contrary herein. 

The Union, the employees and the Hospital agree that during the term of the Agreement, the 
parties shall be covered exclusively by and limited to the terms and provisions of this Agreement 
and that neither the Hospital nor the Union shall be obligated to negotiate with respect to any 
matter pertaining to wages, hours or conditions of employment, whether or not specifically 
included in this Agreement or discussed during the negotiations preceding the execution of this 
Agreement. 

This Agreement shall not be varied or amended by oral agreement or by custom or practice.  No 
addition to, alteration, modification, practice or waiver of any term, provision, covenant, or 
condition or restriction in this Agreement shall be valid, binding, or of any force or effect unless 
made in writing and executed by the Hospital and the Union.  The failure of either party to 
 
51 

exercise any right under this Agreement or to insist upon strict compliance with its provisions 
will not affect the right of either party to exercise any right or to thereafter insist upon strict 
compliance. 

Provided, in the event the Hospital establishes a new job classification within the bargaining unit, 
the Hospital will advise the Union of the proposed wage rate for the position at least thirty (30) 
days in advance of when it intends to fill the position and will bargain in good faith with the 
Union upon request over such wage rate.  If the parties are unable to reach agreement on the 
wage rate for such new job classification within thirty (30) days of the notification to the Union, 
the Hospital may implement said wage rate pending agreement on a different rate (which, if 
agreed upon, would be implemented prospectively only).  If the parties are unable to reach 
agreement on the pay rate for the newly established position, within such thirty (30) day period, 
the Hospital may implement the classification with its proposed wage rate and the Union may 
request arbitration of the issue of the appropriate wage rate for the newly created classification.  
The decision of the arbitrator as to the wage rate, if higher than implemented, shall be 
retroactive, and the Hospital may, if it chooses, discontinue the classification.
