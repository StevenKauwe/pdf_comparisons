ARTICLE 41 

ACCOMMODATION OF DISABILITY 
41.1 
In the event the Hospital, in order to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act 
(ADA), restructures the job duties of a bargaining unit position, or permits an employee to 
transfer to a vacant bargaining unit position outside of the transfer procedure described in Article 
16, in order to accommodate the disability of an employee or job applicant, such action shall not 
be a violation of this Agreement unless the Hospital’s actions are shown to have been taken in 
bad faith or without any supportive documentation from a practicing physician attesting to and 
verifying the existence of any disability creating the need for the accommodation, whether or not 
such accommodation is subsequently found not to be required by state and federal law.  The 
documentation requirement will not necessarily apply in instances where an employee or job 
applicant has a disability which is self-evident, e.g., blindness, missing limb, etc.  The Hospital 
will meet and confer with the Union concerning the need for making an accommodation 
requiring waiver of some provision of this Agreement before implementing such 
accommodation.
