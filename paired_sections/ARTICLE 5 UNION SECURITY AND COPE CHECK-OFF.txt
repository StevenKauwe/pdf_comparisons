UNION SECURITY AND COPE CHECK-OFF 
5.1 
Payroll Deduction of Union Dues. 
Upon the receipt of a signed, written authorization from an employee or a PDF of such 
authorization, the Hospital shall deduct from the employee’s wages an amount equal to monthly 
union membership dues which shall be deducted in a fixed amount each pay period, regardless of 
the employee’s membership status, and remitted to the Union.  Once authorized, payroll check-
off shall be irrevocable for a period of one year and automatically renewed each year thereafter, 
except that authorization may be withdrawn by the sending of a written notice to both the Union 
and Employer by registered mail during the period of ten (10) days immediately succeeding the 
annual anniversary date of the employee’s authorization or beyond the termination date of the 
applicable collective bargaining agreement, whichever occurs sooner. 
Along with the deductions, the Hospital will transmit to the Union, no later than the 10th 
of each month, an electronic or digital standard computer importable data file in a format agreed 
upon by the parties (e.g., comma delimited, excel, etc.) with the following information for all 
bargaining unit employees: First name, last name, address, city, state, zip, employee 
identification number, date of hire, salary or hourly wage, home phone number, department/cost

center, job classification, status (full-time, part-time, VSP), shift (when available from Hospital 
information systems), date of birth, gender, and dues paid for the period.  The file shall be 
transmitted in a manner agreed upon by the parties (e.g., disk, CD ROM, email, etc.).  As 
technology advances, the union reserves the right to make changes to the medium used as the 
standard computer database importable electronic file format and/or method of delivery. 
5.2 
Indemnification of Hospital. 
The Union agrees to indemnify, defend and hold the Hospital harmless against any and 
all claims or suits that may arise out of or by reason of action taken by the Hospital in reliance 
upon authorization cards submitted by the Union.  The Union agrees to refund to the Hospital 
any amounts paid to it in error on account of the payroll deduction provision, upon presentation 
of proper evidence of error or mistake. 
5.3 
Notification of Amount. 
The Union will advise to the Director of Labor Relations or his or her designee, in 
writing, the current rate of membership dues.  The Director of Labor Relations or his or her 
designee will be notified of any change in the rate of membership dues thirty (30) days prior to 
the effective date of such change. 
5.4 
Committee on Political Education. 
The Hospital shall deduct from each employee’s check an amount voluntarily authorized 
for the Committee on Political Education (“COPE”) and submit, bi-weekly to the Union.  Once 
the Union provides a signed, written authorized deduction form for the COPE or a PDF of such 
form to the Hospital, the Hospital will honor the COPE deduction by no later than the next pay 
period beginning after receipt of the authorization. 
5.5 
Continuation of Deductions After Agreement Expiration 
The obligation of the Hospital to continue the deductions provided for in this Article 
following expiration of this Agreement shall be subject to negotiations between the Hospital and 
the Union, and such negotiation shall be separate from negotiations between the parties for a 
successor agreement.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, this Section 5.5 
shall remain in effect following expiration of this Agreement.
