SUBCONTRACTING 
42.1 
During the term of this Agreement, the Hospital will not subcontract work currently 
being performed by bargaining unit employees, except as such work has been historically 
subcontracted to augment staffing on a temporary basis.  The Hospital will not call employees 
off when work that such employees sometimes perform and wish to perform is being done by 
contractor personnel, unless utilization of such employees will not eliminate the need for 
contractor personnel.

Give affected employees a reasonable opportunity to cross-train or attend 
Hospital-sponsored training on paid time (not to exceed eighty {80} hours) in 
classifications which do not require experience or for which the employee may be 
qualified as a result of his/her prior experience and training for which the 
employee has any required education.  Such training shall be limited to positions 
in which vacancies exist or are anticipated within six (6) months from the 
effective date of the layoff due to subcontracting and for which, in the good faith 
judgment of the Hospital, the employee may be able to qualify with such training.

Provide out-placement services such as assistance with resume preparation and 
mailing, employment counseling, etc. 
Relieve employees from duty for up to twenty (20) hours on paid time, with adequate

off due to the subcontracting, and who exercise COBRA continuation rights, the 
difference between the COBRA continuation costs and the cost of the coverage for active 
employees, for the first four (4) months of COBRA continuation. 
During the duration of this Agreement, the Employer will not subcontract any work that would 
result in the elimination of any position held by an Imaging Service Department employee.
