ARTICLE 38 

ATTENDANCE 
38.1 
All staff are expected to maintain regular and predictable attendance to meet performance 
requirements. 
38.2 
The purpose of this policy is to establish consistent attendance standards and the 
consequences for failing to meet expectations. 
38.3 
Definitions. 
Scheduled Absence - Absence from work which has been approved by the employee’s supervisor 
at least 23 hours prior to the beginning of the absence. 
Unscheduled Absence - Absence from work which is not a scheduled absence. 
Standard Occurrence – An unscheduled absence of one shift or the first three consecutive shifts 
will count as one occurrence if the required notification is given (see notification definition 
below). 
Enhanced Occurrence – Extra occurrences added to a Standard Occurrence. 
A. Purpose: The purpose of applying Enhanced Occurrences is to encourage attendance on 
days that have been identified as high call out days because of an identified event or 
holiday. 
B. Applicability: 
i. The Enhanced Occurrences will apply in the following situations: 
a.  When the Unscheduled Absence occurs on a Holiday identified in Article    
32 or a date immediately before or after a Holiday, or 
b. When an Unscheduled Absence occurs on one of nine (9) days identified 
by the Hospital at least sixty (60) days in advance. 
C. Calculation: To determine if Enhanced Occurrences apply, it will first be determined if a 
Standard Occurrence applies. If a Standard Occurrence applies, the first Enhanced 
Occurrence event connected to the Standard Occurrence will result in two occurrences 
and each subsequent Enhanced Occurrence connected with the same Standard 
Occurrence will result in one occurrence. However, the total number of occurrences for 
absenteeism that can be applied to a single Standard Occurrence even in connection with 
a Holiday identified in Article 32 is four (4) and in all other events is three (3). 
If an employee reports to work, but leaves prior to completing one-half of the shift without 
having received approval for the time off at least 23 hour prior to the time he or she leaves, the 
employee will be charged with one occurrence. 
 
50 
In the event an employee leaves work after having completed one-half of the scheduled shift 
without the necessary 23 hours’ approval, the employee will be charged with only one-half of 
one occurrence if the employee reports for work as scheduled for his or her next shift. 
Otherwise, the employee will be charged with one occurrence. 
Excused Absences – Employees who are absent for more than three consecutive shifts must 
apply for a leave of absence consistent with the Hospital’s leave of absence policy. Absences due 
to approved leaves of absence, on-the-job inquiries qualifying for workers’ compensation, 
emergency medical procedures, jury duty, supervisory approved shift trade, bereavement leave, 
and absences from work due to symptoms of seasonal influenza (proper documentation may be 
required) occurring during any period when the Hospital has requested in writing that employees 
not attend work if they are feeling such symptoms, are not counted as occurrences. 
Occurrence of Tardiness - Failure to clock in at the employee’s home department or designated 
location within 5 minutes of scheduled reporting time and report to work immediately thereafter 
counts as one-half occurrence. 
Notification - Requests for time off must be made in accordance with the Hospital’s procedures 
for requesting and documenting requests for such time.  When an employee must be absent from 
work, the employee must call the supervisor as soon as possible, in no event less than three (3) 
hours prior to the beginning of the shift.  A call to anyone other than the supervisor or designated 
individual is not proper notification.  Failing to properly notify the supervisor (or designee) three 
(3) hours prior to the beginning of the shift will result in the employee’s being charged with one 
occurrence in addition to any occurrences for the absence. 
Notification of inability to report for work as scheduled must be made daily unless the employee 
has previously advised his/her supervisor that his/her physician has advised him/her of the need 
to remain out of work for a specified period of time, in which case the employee must forward 
the physician’s statement confirming the need to remain out of work to his/her supervisor as soon 
as possible.  If discipline is given and the employee requests a review of the discipline, the 
Hospital will rescind such discipline if the employee can prove through some objective evidence 
that, due to no fault of the employee, it was not possible to provide the notification required in 
this Section and that he/she did provide notice at the first available opportunity. 
38.4 
No Call / No Show. 
An employee who fails to notify the supervisor (or designee) prior to the beginning of the 
shift and who fails to clock in and report to work within the first two hours of the shift is a no 
call/no show and will be charged with three occurrences.A no call/no show on two (2) occasions 
in a twelve (12) month period will result in termination, unless the employee is absent due to 
hospitalization and is unable to notify the employer. 
38.5 
Disciplinary Procedures. 
Occurrences shall be counted in rolling twelve (12) month periods. 
Five occurrences within a twelve (12) month period will result in a coaching session. 
 
51 
Six occurrences within a twelve (12) month period will result in a first written warning. 
Seven occurrences within a twelve (12) month period will result in a final written 
warning. 
Eight occurrences within a twelve (12) month period will result in a two-day unpaid 
suspension. 
Nine occurrences within a twelve (12) month period will result in termination and will 
constitute just cause for discharge. 
Levels of discipline may be skipped in the event that an employee is tardy more than 
once within a seven-day period. For example, an employee with five (5) tardies in the last twelve 
(12) months is tardy on Saturday and is tardy again the following Monday, and these constitute 
the sixth and seventh occurrences of tardiness in a twelve-month period, the appropriate level of 
discipline would be a two day suspension (8th occurrence level).  In addition, twelve (12) 
instances of tardiness in a twelve (12) month period will result in termination and will constitute 
just cause for discharge. 
Pattern-based discipline: 
An employee’s record will be reviewed periodically by the supervisor for- 
number of absences 
reasons for absence 
patterns of absence 
An employee who demonstrates a pattern of absence - absence generally on Monday or 
Friday (or the employee’s first or last scheduled workday in the week), the day after payday, or 
in conjunction with holidays, or an employee who is regularly absent shortly after an occurrence 
has dropped off his/her record will receive a first written warning when the supervisor sees the 
pattern emerging.  Continued absences in the pattern will result in a final written warning and 
then termination.  Absences during the probationary period may result in discharge without 
regard to this Article. 
The Hospital generally will assign occurrences and issue discipline in a progressive 
manner. However, the Hospital may issue accelerated discipline, up to and including termination, 
in cases of attendance abuse, such as for example pattern-based absences. Pattern-based absences 
may include, but are not limited to, absence generally on Monday or Friday (or the employee’s 
first or last scheduled workday in the week), the day after payday, or an employee who is 
regularly absent shortly after an occurrence has dropped off his/her record. 
If an employee is absent on a shift for which PTO was requested other than pursuant to 
the Round One, Two and Three requested as set out in Sections 29.7.4 or 29.7.5 shall count as a 
total of two occurrences. 
Absences during the probationary period may result in discharge without regard to the 
Article.
