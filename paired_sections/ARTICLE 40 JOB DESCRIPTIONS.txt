JOB DESCRIPTIONS 
40.1 
The Hospital will maintain job descriptions which include general summaries of the job 
duties of bargaining unit positions.  When job descriptions for bargaining unit positions are 
revised to reflect changes in duties, the Hospital will give the Union at least thirty (30) days 
advance notice of the changes.  If such revisions require the development of significantly higher 
skills, require additional education or training that will not be provided by the Hospital, or 
actually require that the employee perform a significantly greater volume of work on a regular 
basis, the Hospital will, upon request, bargain with the Union to agreement or impasse over the 
effects of such revisions.  However, such bargaining need not be completed before 
implementation of such revisions. 
40.2 
In the event that an employee believes that he/she is performing, on other than a 
temporary basis, the duties of a bargaining unit position other than the position for which the 
employee is classified, the employee may apply to the Vice President of the Human Resources 
Department for re-examination of his/her duties and job classification.  The Director of Labor 
Relations or his or her designee, shall respond in writing to such application within thirty (30) 
days of receipt.  If unresolved, the employee, or the Union on behalf of the employee, may 
initiate grievance proceedings.  In such a grievance, the issue for resolution will be which 
existing bargaining unit classification should be applicable to the employee.  Nothing in this 
 
54 
Article shall authorize an arbitrator to establish a new or different job classification or require 
revisions to an existing job classification. 
40.3 
In the event that the Hospital (as opposed to the government) implements a new 
requirement for training applicable to incumbent employees, the Hospital will provide or pay for 
the cost of the training.  Time spent in such training will be treated and paid for as hours worked. 
This does not apply to changes in skill mix requiring different classifications or to continuing 
educational requirements imposed for licensure or by Medicare/Medicaid or other 
reimbursement authorities. 
40.4 
In the event that the government implements a new requirement for training applicable to 
incumbent employees, the Hospital will, upon request, meet and bargain with the Union over the 
issue of what, if any, of the costs associated with obtaining the training will be paid for by the 
Hospital.
