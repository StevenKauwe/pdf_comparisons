The PTO program is in addition to Jury Duty and Bereavement Leave, and any other 
agreed upon paid leave. 
29.2 
Maximum Accrual. 
PTO accruals may not exceed the maximum accrual for a given years of service.  Once 
an employee’s PTO reaches the maximum accrual, PTO will cease accruing until the accrual is 
reduced below the maximum. 
29.3 
Voluntary Cash Out. 
Employees may cash out accrued PTO in excess of eighty (80) hours twice per calendar 
year, at $ 0.90 on the dollar.  Minimum cash out is eight (8) hours. 
29.4 
Automatic Cash Out. 
An employee who, after three months of employment, terminates employment or reduces 
status to VSP, will be paid for all accrued PTO at one hundred percent (100%) of the value of the 
PTO.  PTO is accrued in the last pay period worked as follows: one (I) to forty (40) hours ~ one-
half (1/2) of bi-weekly accrual; forty-one (41) + hours worked ~ full bi-weekly accrual.  An 
employee whose status is reduced from full-time to part-time who has PTO accruals in excess of 
 
36 
the maximum for part-time employees will cease accruing PTO until the accrual is reduced 
below the part-time maximum. 
29.5 
Not Hours Worked. 
PTO hours paid are not counted as hours worked for any purpose. 
29.6 
Use of PTO. 
PTO may not be used during the first ninety (90) days of employment, except for 
holidays.  After ninety (90) days of employment, PTO is paid whenever an employee is absent 
from work due to illness (prior to STD eligibility for full-time and part-time employees) or for 
vacation or personal days.  Employees will not normally be permitted to take time off without 
utilizing PTO. However, employees may choose to use PTO if they are called off due to low 
census or if the employee takes a regularly scheduled day off during a week in which the 
employee picks up additional shifts and thus works forty (40) hours (or, for part-time employees, 
a number of hours equal to his/her normal schedule). 
29.7 
Requesting and Scheduling of PTO. 
29.7.1 
It is understood that the Hospital has a duty to ensure that it has adequate, 
fully qualified staff on hand at all times to meet its operations 
requirements without significant use of overtime or temporary Employees 
for relief.  This duty will be taken into account when scheduling PTO for 
Employees. 
29.7.2 
Employees may submit vacation requests electronically through the 
Hospital’s electronic scheduling system, currently Facility Scheduler, or if 
elected by the department director, via paper forms.  Employees may 
request to take up to a total of four consecutive weeks of PTO in a 
calendar year. 
29.7.3 
For purposes of this Article, “work week” or “week” is defined as a period 
of seven consecutive days beginning on the day of the week on which the 
schedule (posted pursuant to Article 14) begins. 
29.7.4 
January through June PTO Requests. 
Requests to use PTO in each unit or department during the first six months 
of the year (January 2nd – June) may be submitted between September 1st 
and September 30th of the prior calendar year.  During this same time 
period, each unit or department will solicit volunteers to work on the 
following Memorial Day.  Requests to use PTO that are submitted during 
this time period will be considered as follows: 
i. 
Round One:  each Employee’s request for up to two full 
consecutive weeks of PTO will be granted if available in each unit 
or department in seniority order. 
 
37 
ii. 
Round Two:  each Employee’s requests for up to two full weeks of 
PTO will be granted if available in each unit or department in 
seniority order. 
iii. 
Round Three:  any further requests for PTO will be granted if 
available in each unit or department in seniority order. 
After all requests that were submitted by the September 30th deadline 
have been granted if available then any PTO requests submitted after the 
September 30th deadline will be granted if available on a “first come, first 
served” basis, regardless of seniority.  The unit or department will post its 
semi-annual PTO calendar by November 1st of the prior calendar year. 
29.7.5 
July through December PTO Requests. 
In granting PTO to be taken between July and December each year (including 
New Year’s Day of the following year), requests for PTO during holidays will 
first be considered pursuant to Section 29.7.5.1 and then other requests for 
PTO will be considered pursuant to Section 29.7.5.2. 
29.7.5.1 
Between January 1st and January 31st each calendar year, each 
unit or department will solicit volunteers to work on July 4th of 
that calendar year, Labor Day of that calendar year, Thanksgiving 
of that calendar year, Christmas of that calendar year, and New 
Year’s Day of the following calendar year.  Also, between January 
1st and January 31st each calendar year, Employees may submit 
requests to use PTO in each unit or department for one of the 
following three:  Thanksgiving of that calendar year; Christmas 
Day of that calendar year; or New Year’s Day of the following 
calendar year.  On a seniority-based rotational basis the Hospital 
will consider each Employee’s request for PTO for one of these 
days that is submitted during this time period.  Such requests will 
be granted if available.  After all requests submitted during this 
time period have been granted if available additional requests for 
more than one (1) holiday will not be unreasonably denied.  Each 
unit or department will post a calendar of PTO granted pursuant to 
this subsection by February 28th of each calendar year. 
29.7.5.2 
Requests to use PTO in each unit or department during the second 
six months of the year (July – December) may be submitted 
between March 1st and March 31st of the current calendar year.  
Requests that are submitted during this time period will be 
considered as follows. 
i. 
Round One:  each Employee’s request for up to two full 
consecutive weeks of PTO will be granted if available in 
each unit or department in seniority order. 
 
38 
ii. 
Round Two:  each Employee’s requests for up to two full 
weeks of PTO will be granted if available in each unit or 
department in seniority order. 
iii. 
Round Three:  any further requests for PTO will be granted 
if available in each unit or department in seniority order. 
After all requests that were submitted by the March 31st 
deadline have been granted if available then any PTO requests 
submitted after the March 31st deadline will be granted if available 
on a “first come, first served” basis, regardless of seniority.  The 
unit or department will post its semi-annual PTO calendar by May 
1st of each calendar year. 
29.7.6 
Approval of PTO Requests. 
Requests for use of PTO for planned absences will be approved based on the staffing 
needs of the unit or department.  PTO requests may be denied whenever, in the judgment of the 
Hospital, granting the request would jeopardize staffing levels or compromise patient care.  Once 
approved, PTO requests will not be changed or rescinded by the Hospital except (i) in the event 
of implementation of the Hospital’s disaster plan  or (ii) to the extent that the employee will not 
have sufficient PTO to cover the absence.  If the employee does not have sufficient PTO to cover 
the absence, the employee may request to take the pre-scheduled PTO as unpaid time, and such 
requests may be approved by management.  Such requests will be granted to the extent that the 
lack of available PTO is a consequence of non-discretionary usage (non-voluntary call off, 
bereavement leave, general medical leave, FMLA, or Workers Comp leave). 
29.7.7 
New Hires 
If an employee is hired after the deadlines set forth above for holiday scheduling, then 
they will be given the opportunity to volunteer for holidays, and will be added to the holiday 
schedule according to seniority as needed. 
29.8 
Donation of PTO. 
Vacation time (in increments of no less than one hour) can be transferred from one 
employee to another employee who is experiencing a hardship situation.  A bona fide hardship is 
limited to situations of illness or injury to the recipient employee, or illness or injury of an 
immediate family member of the recipient employee. 
In order to receive a vacation contribution, the recipient employee’s vacation account 
(and in the case of the employee’s own illness, the recipient’s sick leave accounts) must be 
exhausted.  Employees who wish to donate vacation must have a minimum of forty (40) hours 
remaining in their balance after the donation.  Employees may not donate more than fifty percent 
(50%) of their accrued vacation balance.

Section 5. 
Not Hours Worked 
PTO hours paid are not counted as hours worked for any purpose. 
Section 6. 
Use of PTO 
PTO may not be used during the first ninety (90) days of employment, except for holidays.  After 
ninety (90) days of employment, PTO is paid whenever an employee is absent from work due to 
illness (prior to STD eligibility for full-time and part-time employees) or for vacation or personal 
days.  Employees will not normally be permitted to take time off without utilizing PTO.  
However, employees may choose to use PTO or elect to take unpaid time for missed work if they 
are called off due to low census or if the employee takes a regularly scheduled day off during a 
week in which the employee picks up additional shifts and thus works forty (40) hours (or, for 
part-time employees, a number of hours equal to his/her normal schedule).  If there is no PTO 
available, the employee may request time off without pay to a maximum of forty (40) hours 
within a rolling twelve (12) month period.  The Employer shall not unreasonably deny such a 
request. 
Section 7. 
Scheduling of PTO 
(a) 
The operating and scheduling needs of a department/unit are primary when a 
supervisor approves or denies PTO requests.  Requests for PTO are handled in the order they are 
received and according to department scheduling policies. 
(b) 
When two (2) or more requests are received at the same time, the supervisor may 
give preference to the employee with more years of department service. 
(c) 
PTO requests must be made in advance and approved by the manager before they 
are considered a scheduled absence from work.  Failure to give proper notification and/or receive 
approval for the absence will result in the time off being considered an unscheduled absence and 
subject to disciplinary action. 
(d) 
Holiday Scheduling.  In making decisions for prime holidays, (defined as 
Thanksgiving day, Christmas Day, and New Year's day) scheduling will be undertaken on a 
rotational basis.  The list will start with the most senior employee and work backwards.  
Volunteers will always be solicited first to work on prime holidays.  A permanent log will be 
available for any employee to view in each department. 
(e) 
If an employee changes shifts, departments or positions, a PTO request will be 
considered to have been submitted on the effective date of the transfer. 
(f) 
Requests for use of PTO for planned absences will be approved based on the 
staffing needs of the work unit.  PTO requests may be denied whenever, in the judgment of the 
Hospital, granting the request would jeopardize staffing levels or compromise patient care.  Once 
approved, vacation requests will not be changed or rescinded by the Hospital except in the event 
of implementation of the Hospital’s disaster plan.  Provided, pre-scheduled vacation may be 
cancelled by the Hospital to the extent that the employee will not have sufficient PTO to cover 
the absence.  In such cases, the employee may request to take the pre-scheduled vacation as 
 
36 

unpaid time, and such requests may be approved by management.  Such requests will be granted 
to the extent that the lack of available PTO is a consequence of non-discretionary usage (drop 
days, bereavement leave, medical, FMLA, or workers comp leave). 
Section 8. 
Donation of PTO 
Vacation time can be transferred from an employee to another employee who is experiencing a 
hardship situation.  A bona fide hardship is limited to situations of illness or injury to the 
recipient employee, or illness or injury of an immediate family member of the recipient 
employee. 
In order to receive a vacation contribution, the recipient employee’s vacation account (and in the 
case of the employee’s own illness, the recipient’s sick leave accounts) must be exhausted.  
Employees who wish to donate vacation must have a minimum of forty (40) hours remaining in 
their balance after the donation.  Employees may not donate more than 50% of their accrued 
vacation balance. 
Donated PTO hours cannot be retrieved by the donor at a later date.
