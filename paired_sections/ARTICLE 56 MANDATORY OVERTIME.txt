ARTICLE 56 

MANDATORY OVERTIME 
There shall be no mandatory overtime except under the following circumstances: If (1) a 
state of emergency is declared by City, County, State or Federal authorities, or (2) an “Internal 
Disaster” is declared by the Hospital within four (4) hours of the end of a shift.  In these 
circumstances, the Hospital(s) impacted may require the affected employees to remain on duty 
for up to four (4) hours beyond the end of the scheduled shift.  However, to the extent that time 
permits, the Hospital will make reasonable efforts to secure volunteers from the staff on premises 
and from resources outside the Hospital, before implementing such a requirement.  In the 
circumstances described in this subparagraph, volunteers or employees required to remain on 
duty will be paid double time for the hours worked beyond their scheduled shift.
