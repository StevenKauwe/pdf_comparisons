16.1 
Whenever a job opening occurs in the bargaining unit and the Hospital intends to fill the 
opening, notice of the vacancy will be posted on the Sunrise Website for at least seven calendar 
days.  The Hospital may extend the posting period for any vacancy. Minimum qualifications, pay 
grade, department/cost center and shift (if fixed) shall be noted on the posting.  An employee 
tenders his/her bid by completing any appropriate online documentation. 
16.2 
In filling vacancies in bargaining unit positions, the Hospital shall evaluate internal 
applicants based on their qualifications. To assist in evaluating qualifications as set out in the 
position job description, the Hospital will utilize a peer interview panel composed of bargaining 
 
24 
unit employees who have direct knowledge of the job requirements and qualifications of the 
vacant position. The Hospital shall accept the peer interview panel’s recommendation unless the 
Hospital has a compelling reason for not doing so based on the applicant’s experience, skill, 
ability, knowledge, performance in current position, and disciplinary record (if any), will be 
considered. For the purpose of this Section, verbal counselings, or discipline (other than final 
warnings and suspensions) older than two years will not be considered. 
In the event that the best qualified applicants have relatively equal qualifications, in the 
good faith judgment of the Hospital, which shall be based on the foregoing criteria, the Hospital 
will award the position as follows: 
16.2.1 
To the full-time or part-time applicant with the greatest Seniority working 
in the unit/department (See Appendix D) where the vacancy exists; 
16.2.2 
Next to the VSP applicant with the longest continuous service with the 
Hospital working in the unit/department where the vacancy exists; 
16.2.3 
Next to the full-time or part-time applicant with the greatest seniority 
working outside of the unit/department where the vacancy exists;

position within the bargaining unit if there are no qualified applicants from 
the bargaining unit. 
16.3 
The Hospital will make every reasonable effort to place a successful applicant in the new 
position within thirty (30) days of selection.  RNs newly hired into a job in the RN General 
classification will be ineligible to apply for other vacancies until they have at least one (1) year 
of experience at Sunrise as a registered nurse, unless the service period is waived in writing by 
the Hospital.  Employees selected to fill vacancies will be ineligible to apply for other vacancies 
for one hundred eighty (180) days from the date of transfer or promotion, unless the service 
period is waived in writing by the Hospital.  This limitation will not apply to transfers in the 
same classification to increase hours or to applications for promotion by employees with at least 
six (6) months service with the Hospital. 
16.4 
Employees who are promoted or transferred to another bargaining unit position through 
the bidding process, shall have up to ninety (90) days of evaluation of their performance.  If, at 
any time within such ninety (90) day period, the employee fails to perform to the satisfaction of 
the Hospital, the Hospital may, in its discretion and as an alternative to following the counseling 
and disciplinary process, return the employee to his/her former position, including shift, 
assignment, and scheduled hours, and rate of pay without loss of seniority.
