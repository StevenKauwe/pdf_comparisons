ABSENCE FROM WORK 
30.1 
Employees shall report any absence from their scheduled shift to their manager (or other 
member of supervision designated to receive such notice by the manager) three (3) hours in 
advance of the scheduled starting time of their shift, unless an emergency, clearly beyond the 
control of the employee, makes it impossible to do so. 
30.2 
Whenever an employee is absent due to personal illness or injury for three (3) or more 
successive shifts, the Hospital may require that the employee provide a physician’s certificate 
confirming an illness, the dates of care, and the date the employee is expected to be sufficiently 
recovered to return to work.  Such certification may also be required for a single day of absence, 
whenever an employee has received a written warning under the attendance policy during the 
prior six (6) months, or in the event of circumstances surrounding the absence which raise 
reasonable questions as to the validity of the absence.  Employees shall have seven (7) days to 
obtain and produce such certificate if requested.  The Hospital reserves the right to require a 
fitness-for-duty certification from a physician whenever, in the good faith judgment of the 
Hospital, there is a question as to the fitness-of-duty of an employee seeking to return to work 
following an absence due to illness.  The Hospital also may require fitness-for-duty examinations 
in circumstances permitted under Federal law or regulation, i.e. the examination is job related 
and consistent with business necessity.  If the Hospital removes an employee from his or her 
scheduled shifts pending a fitness-for-duty examination, the affected employee will be placed on 
paid administrative leave (at straight time pay) pending the examination, provided the employee 
will not be paid for any delay caused by the employee or the examination concludes the 
employee was not fit for duty.
