ON-CALL/CALL BACK 
28.1 
On-Call Pay. 
The Hospital may require employees to remain on-call whenever, in the judgment of the 
Hospital, it is necessary to do so to be assured of having adequate staff available.  Employees 
required to be On-Call, shall be paid $6.00 per hour for all hours spent on-call, except for those 
hours when the employee has clocked in.  Pagers will be provided to those Hospital employees 
who are required to carry pagers while on-call.  Employees not required to carry a pager have the 
option of giving the Hospital the number of the employee’s personal pager or advising the 
Hospital of a telephone number at which the employee may be reached throughout the period the 
employee is on-call.  It is the employee’s responsibility to assure that any telephone number 
given to the Hospital remains available for incoming calls.  In order to meet emergent patient 
care needs employees on-call in Thirty-Minute Call Departments are expected to report to work 
as soon as reasonably possible when called back and are expected to make every effort to report 
in not more than 30 minutes, provided, however, employees hired in the Cath Lab after June 12, 
2014 and employees in other Thirty-Minute Call Departments hired after December 22, 2017 
must report to work in not more than 30 minutes.  Thirty-Minute Call Departments are Cath Lab, 
OR, ED, Special Procedures (inclusive of the IR staff and the Radiology nurse on call), and 
L&D.  All other unit/departments are expected to respond in no more than 45 minutes.  It is 
understood that emergent situations and other circumstances beyond the employee’s control may 
occur which prevent the employee from meeting these requirements and these will be evaluated 
on a case by case basis.  Lack of reliable transportation is not a valid excuse for failure to report.  
In order for discipline to be imposed, the Hospital bears the burden of establishing that an 
employee failed to meet the standards set forth above. 
Failure to report for duty within ninety (90) minutes (or within sixty (60) minutes for 
employees in the Thirty-Minute Call Departments) shall result in loss of On-Call Pay and Call 
Back Premium (including travel time) and may result in being sent home if arrangements have 
been made to cover the need by the time the employee reports.  Additionally, such employees 
shall be subject to accelerated discipline.  If the Employer needs to discipline an employee, then 
 
34 
the Employer shall notify the Union of such intent before the discipline is issued. 
28.2 
On-Call Hours. 
a. 
Call schedules covering a maximum of six (6) weeks will be posted at least 
thirteen (13) days in advance of the beginning of the schedule.  No employee can 
remove themselves from the Call Schedule, but may continue to trade call with 
other employees.  Sunrise Hospital will make reasonable efforts to limit on-call 
hours to twenty-four (24) hours per week, unless operational or business needs of 
the Hospital prohibit such limitation.  This Section shall not be construed as to 
prevent an employee from requesting and receiving additional on-call hours.  The 
Hospital will make reasonable efforts to rotate mandatory on-call equitably 
among qualified employees in the required classification.  Employees fifty-five 
(55) years of age or older with at least eighteen (18) months of service will not 
normally be required to take call.  The parties recognize that from time to time a 
unit or department may not be capable of covering call due to a lack of qualified 
staff under the age of fifty-five (55).  In such circumstances, exempted employees 
may be assigned call, on a rotating basis, for assignments for which they are 
qualified.  Pre-scheduled on-call hours will be offered to full-time employees 
before VSP employees. 
b. 
In the Surgery department, the Hospital will continue to make reasonable efforts 
to limit on-call hours to sixteen (16) per week, except that employees will take 
call for an additional forty-eight (48) hours on the weekend on an every fifth (5th) 
week rotation.  This Section shall not be construed as to prevent an employee 
from requesting and receiving additional on-call hours, if the manager feels that 
assigning such additional hours would be consistent with the provision of quality 
patient care.  The Surgery department will make reasonable efforts to rotate on-
call equitably among qualified employees in the required classification.  Pre-
scheduled on-call hours will be offered to full-time and part-time employees 
before VSP employees. 
28.3 
Call-Back Pay. 
If called to work after having left the Hospital’s property when On-Call, an employee 
shall be paid, a minimum of two (2) hours of Call-Back premium pay at the rate of one and one-
half (1½,) times the employee’s straight time hourly rate for all hours actually worked, plus one 
(1) hour at the employee’s base hourly rate of pay to compensate the employee for time spent in 
traveling to and from the Hospital.  The one (1) hour of travel time pay will be added to hours 
worked for overtime purposes.  Travel time pay will not be paid for a call-back if there is less 
than thirty (30) minutes between the clock-in and the clock-out from a prior call-back.  
Employees will not receive call-back pay for returning to the Hospital for staff development 
meetings or other scheduled meetings. 
28.4 
Contiguous Call. 
 
35 
Employees in On-Call status contiguous to their work shift do not have to leave the 
Hospital’s property or clock out to be eligible to receive Call-back premium pay (not including 
travel time pay) referenced in Section 3 above.

Section 1. 
On-Call Pay 
The Hospital may require employees to remain on-call whenever, in the judgment of the 
Hospital, it is necessary to do so to be assured of having adequate staff available.  Employees 
required to be on-call, shall be paid $6.00 per hour for all hours spent on-call, except for those 
hours when the employee has clocked in.  Employees will be paid $6.00 per hour for Holiday 
and Weekend call.  Pagers will be provided to those Hospital employees who are required to 
carry pagers while on-call.  Employees not required to carry a pager have the option of giving the 
Hospital the number of the employee’s personal pager or advising the Hospital of a telephone 
number at which the employee may be reached throughout the period the employee is on-call.  It 
is the employee’s responsibility to assure that any telephone number given to the Hospital 
remains available for incoming calls.  In order to meet emergent patient care needs Employees 
on-call in Thirty-Minute Call Departments are expected to report to work as soon as reasonably 
possible when called back and are expected to make every effort to report in not more than 30 
minutes; provided, however, a job requirement for employees accepting positions in Thirty-
Minute Call Departments after December 21, 2017 and employees on the Trauma Team, when 
designated, is to report to work in not more than 30 minutes.  Thirty-minute Call Departments 
are Cath Lab, OR, ED, Medical Imaging, and L&D.  Upon being called back to work from stand-
by, employees in all other departments should report to work at the Hospital as soon as 
reasonably possible and in no more than forty-five (45) minutes. 
A failure to report for duty following call-back shall result in the following progressive discipline 
for each offense within a twelve (12) month period: 
(a) 
Failure to report for duty within forty-five (45) minutes (or 30 minutes for Thirty-
Minute Call Departments): 
• 
1st Occurrence -  
Written Warning 
• 
2nd Occurrence -  
Second written warning and loss of on-call pay and 
call-back premium 
• 
3rd Occurrence -  
Twenty-four (24) hour (of scheduled work) 
suspension without pay and loss of on-call pay and 
call-back premium 
• 
4th Occurrence -  
Termination and loss of on-call pay and call-back 
premium 
(b) 
Failure to report for duty within ninety (90) minutes (or 60 minutes for Thirty-
Minute Call Departments): 
• 
1st Occurrence -  
Suspension Without Pay for one (1) scheduled shift 
(eight (8), ten (10), or twelve (12)) and loss of on-
call pay and call-back premium (including travel 
time) and may be sent home if arrangements have 
 
33 

been made to cover the need by the time the 
employee reports. 
• 
2nd Occurrence -  
Termination and loss of on-call pay and call-back 
premium 
For purposes of this Section, precedents in the administration of this Section shall have 
application only within the same unit. 
For the above disciplinary schedule, if discipline is given and the employee requests a review of 
the discipline, the Hospital will rescind such discipline if the employee can prove through some 
objective evidence that, due to no fault of the employee, it was not possible to arrive within 
forty-five (45) minutes (or 30 minutes for Thirty-Minute Call Departments).  However, lack of 
reliable transportation is not a valid excuse for failure to report. 
Section 2. 
On-Call Hours 
(a) 
Call schedules covering a maximum of six (6) weeks will be posted at least 
thirteen (13) days in advance of the beginning of the schedule.  No employee can remove 
themselves from the call schedule, but may continue to trade call with other employees.  The 
Hospital will make reasonable efforts to limit on-call hours to twenty-four (24) hours per week, 
unless operational or business needs of the Hospital prohibit such limitation.  This Section shall 
not be construed as to prevent an employee from requesting and receiving additional on-call 
hours.  The Hospital will make reasonable efforts to rotate mandatory on-call equitably among 
qualified employees in the required classification.  Employees with fifteen (15) years of Hospital 
service will not normally be required to take call.  The parties recognize that from time to time a 
unit or department may not be capable of covering call due to a lack of qualified staff who have 
less than fifteen (15) years of service.  In such circumstances, exempted employees may be 
assigned call, on a rotating basis, for assignments for which they are qualified.  Pre-scheduled 
on-call hours will be offered to full-time employees before VSP employees. 
Section 3. 
Call-Back Pay 
If called to work after having left the Hospital’s property when on-call, an employee shall be 
paid, a minimum of two (2) hours of call-back premium pay at the rate of one and one-half (1-½) 
times the employee’s straight time hourly rate for all hours actually worked, plus one (1) hour at 
the employee’s base hourly rate of pay to compensate the employee for time spent in traveling to 
and from the Hospital.  The one (1) hour of travel time pay will be added to hours worked for 
overtime purposes.  Travel time pay will not be paid for a call-back if there is less than thirty 
(30) minutes between the clock-in and the clock-out from a prior call-back.  Employees will not 
receive call-back pay for returning to the Hospital for staff development meetings or other 
scheduled meetings. 
Section 4. 
Contiguous Call 
Employees in on-call status contiguous to their work shift do not have to leave the Hospital’s 
property or clock out to be eligible to receive call-back premium pay (not including travel time 
pay) referenced in Section 3 above.
