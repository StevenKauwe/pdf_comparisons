Effective the first pay period beginning on or after July 1, 2024, the 2023-
2024 scales and all employee’s wages will be increased by 4.5% and, in

Effective the first pay period beginning on or after July 1, 2025, the 2024-
2025 scales and all employee’s wages will be increased by 4.0% and, in 
addition, all employees shall progress across the applicable scale based on 
their full years of credited experience as of July 1, 2025 at the new wage 
scale rate. 
48.2 
Minimum Rates. 
All wage ranges, benefits and other economic provisions of this Agreement establish 
minimums, and nothing herein shall be deemed or construed to limit the Employer’s right to 
increase wage rates, benefits, premiums and differentials, and to pay other extra compensation at 
the Employer’s discretion in excess of those provided by this Agreement.  Accordingly, it is also 
understood that any such increases shall be over and above the economic package negotiated in 
this Agreement.  Before taking any action, the Employer shall notify the Union and meet and 
confer over the proposed changes. 
48.3 
In the event an employee is promoted to a position in a higher pay grade, the employee 
will be placed on the appropriate step based on his/her credited experience that results in at least 
a 4% wage increase.  Such employee shall thereafter progress across the wages scales only as 
called for by his or her credited experience. 
48.4 
In the event an employee voluntarily transfers to a position in a lower pay grade or is 
demoted, the employee will be placed on the appropriate step based on his/her credited 
experience.  Employees returning to a position held within the prior 90 days will be given the 
wage rate they would have had if they had remained in the position.  In the event an employee 
transfers into a lower pay grade in order to avoid being involuntarily laid off, and if the 
employee’s rate prior to the transfer is higher than the rate to which the employee would be 
entitled to receive in the new position, based on his/her credited experience, the employee’s rate 
would be “red circled” at his current rate (not greater than the max rate for the new 
classification) and the employee’s rate would thereafter remain the same until such time he or 
she would be entitled to an increase based the applicable scale and his or her credited experience.

WAGES 
48.1 
Effective the first pay period beginning after the date of ratification of this Agreement, 
the 2022-2023 scales and all employee’s wages will be increased by 5.25%.  (See 
Appendix D.)  (See Appendix E for VSP rates.) 
* 
The Hospital shall implement this 5.25% wage increase promptly following 
ratification of the Agreement. 
48.2 
Effective the first pay period beginning on or after July 1, 2024, the 2023-2024 scales and 
all employee’s wages will be increased by 4.5% and, in addition, all employees shall 
progress across the applicable scale based on their full years of credited experience as of 
July 1, 2024 at the new wage scale rate. 
48.3 
Effective the first pay period beginning on or after July 1, 2025, the 2024-2025 scales and 
all employee’s wages will be increased by 4.0% and, in addition, all employees shall 
progress across the applicable scale based on their full years of credited experience as of 
July 1, 2025 at the new wage scale rate. 
48.4 
On occasions, it may be necessary to provide hiring and retention bonuses in addition to 
wage and benefits express in this Agreement.  The decision to give, the conditions of 
receipt, and the amount of such bonuses will be determined in the sole discretion of 
Southern Hills Hospital. 
48.5 
The pay grades rates established herein are minimums.  If the Hospital concludes that it is 
necessary to adjust wage rates for all incumbent employees in a given classification, it 
may do so, so long as all incumbent employees in the same job classification receive the 
same percentage adjustment.  However, prior to making any such adjustment, the 
Hospital will advise the Union at least thirty (30) days in advance and will, if requested, 
hold a meeting with the Union during such thirty (30) day period for the purpose of 
explaining the reason for the adjustment. 
48.6 
In hiring new employees, the Hospital shall determine the number of years of credited 
experience the employee has for the job classification into which he/she is being hired.  
The Hospital’s judgment as to the appropriate number of years of experience with which 
to credit a new hire or an employee transferring into a higher pay grade, shall be final, 
unless the employee files a timely grievance upon being advised of the amount of 
experience with which he/she is being credited and, in support of the grievance, provides 
 
58 

clear and convincing evidence of experience for which the Hospital’s failure to give the 
employee credit is arbitrary and capricious. 
48.7 
In the event an RN is promoted to Critical Care RN, he/she will be placed on his/her 
same step on the Critical Care RN pay scale.  In the event an employee in the Service & 
Maintenance Bargaining Unit is promoted to a position in a higher pay grade, the 
employee will be placed on the appropriate step based on his/her credited experience that 
does not result in a reduction in pay. 
48.8 
In the event an employee transfers to a position in a lower pay grade or is demoted, the 
employee’s pay will be reduced by 4% in base rate for each labor grade his/her new 
position is below his/her current labor grade, but not less than the minimum nor greater 
than the maximum rate for the new job grade.
