HOURS OF WORK AND OVERTIME 
26.1 
Work Week. 
A workweek is a period of time consisting of seven (7) consecutive days.  Nothing in this 
agreement shall be construed to constitute a guarantee or entitlement of hours of work per day or 
per week. 
26.2 
No Pyramiding. 
 
31 
There shall be no pyramiding of overtime pay.  Hours (other than holiday worked hours 
and transport duty hours) which qualify for a premium of at least time and one-half the straight-
time hourly rate will not be counted for purposes of determining whether any other hours worked 
qualify for premium or overtime pay. 
26.3 
Hours Worked. 
Only hours actually worked shall be considered hours worked for purposes of computing 
overtime pay. 
The Hospital shall ensure that an employee who has worked continuously for more than 
sixteen (16) hours straight will have at least eight (8) hours off before having to return to work as 
part of the regular schedule.  An employee may choose to use PTO for such time as the employee 
is excused from work on the succeeding shift. 
Employees may be required to review, and verify as accurate, their hours worked each 
pay period. 
26.4 
Overtime Premiums. 
The Hospital will continue to pay overtime pursuant to its current practices. 
If an employee is required to attend mandatory meetings or mandatory in-service training 
sessions during time which is outside of the employee’s regularly scheduled shift, the employee 
shall be paid at the applicable hourly rate, including any applicable differentials, for all time 
spent in such status.  All time or hours spent in such meetings or training shall be considered 
hours worked for the purposes of computing overtime. 
Should there be an insufficient number of volunteers, overtime shall be rotated equitably 
and fairly among the fully qualified employees in the classification on duty or scheduled to be on 
duty in the unit at the time the overtime is required. 
If an employee works an extra shift or extra hours outside his/her regular schedule and 
the Hospital finds that it needs to reduce scheduled hours later in the pay period in order to offset 
the unscheduled hours, it will do so only through voluntary reductions or through the call-off 
procedure. 
26.5 
Rest and Meal Periods. 
Patient care needs permitting, employees will continue to receive one (I) thirty (30) 
minute unpaid meal period as well as two (2) fifteen minute paid rest breaks per scheduled shift 
of at least eight (8) hours granted consistent with current practice (including scheduling 
practices) in each work area.  The Hospital will make reasonable efforts to permit employees to 
take their breaks at reasonable intervals, but the parties recognize that in some clinical areas of 
the Hospital it is not always possible to grant such breaks on any given day.  Employees may not 
leave the Hospital’s premises during rest breaks.  Employees may leave the Hospital’s premises 
during lunch breaks unless operational needs require that the employee be available for 
immediate recall to work.  Employees wishing to leave the Hospital’s premises during lunch 
 
32 
must do so with the permission of their supervisor (which shall not be unreasonably withheld) 
and must clock out and in.  Employees may not combine rest periods and/or meal periods 
without the prior permission of their supervisor.  In the event an employee has been directed to 
remain at his or her work station during a meal period the employee shall remain in paid status.  
If an employee works an additional four (4) hours beyond his/her regular shift, he/she shall be 
entitled to an additional paid rest break.  Some or all employees may be required to badge, 
punch, or sign in and out for lunch.

employee is qualified and shall be guaranteed two (2) hours work or pay in lieu thereof at the 
employee’s regular rate of pay.
