STAFF DEVELOPMENT 
39.1 
The Hospital will continue to maintain an in-service education and orientation program 
with programs posted in advance.  In-service education programs will be scheduled in an effort 
to accommodate varying work schedules.  Orientation for Registered Nurses will consist of a 
basic comprehensive program in which the nurse will be oriented through a combination of 
instructional conferences, floor, and/or shift work.  Newly hired RNs shall not ordinarily be 
counted in the staffing compliment during the first two weeks of orientation.  A newly hired 
nurse may, in exceptional cases only, be counted in the staffing compliment during the first two 
weeks of orientation, provided that the nurse has the requisite skills, has had the opportunity to 
be apprised of all pertinent Hospital policies and procedures, and is able to fully and competently 
perform all those duties required for the care of the majority of patients on the unit on which the 
nurse is working.  The period of orientation may be shortened or lengthened by the Nurse 
Manager based on an individual assessment of the nurse’s clinical competency.  The procedures 
and content for such programs shall be appropriate subjects for discussion by the Labor-
Management/Patient Care Committee.  Such programs shall be consistent with the standards 
established by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations.  The 
employer recognizes that the availability of continuing education opportunities for its nurses is 
essential to ensure quality patient care.  A regular and on-going staff development program shall 
be maintained and made available to employees covered by this Agreement.  The existence, 
content and attendance requirements of the program may be discussed and considered by the 
Labor-Management/Patient Care Committee. 
39.2 
Maintenance of In-Service Education. 
The Hospital, recognizing the importance of education in providing quality health care, 
shall maintain an in-service education program which includes assignment-related training, 
where appropriate. 
39.3 
There shall be an effective in-service education program for employees at the Hospital, 
the contents of which shall be determined by the Hospital.  In-service shall cover, among other 
subjects, orientation for new employees and continuing education of all employees on Hospital 
policies and procedures, new techniques, new equipment, new concepts of care, duties and 
responsibilities, etc.  When requested by the Hospital, attendance shall be mandatory. 
39.4 
Required Attendance.  If the Hospital in its discretion requires an employee to attend an 
in-service educational program provided by the Hospital or an educational program outside of 
the Hospital, the time spent at such meeting shall be considered compensable working time and 
employees shall be reimbursed (per IRS standards) for any reasonable fees or travel expenses 
incurred in connection with a program held outside of the Hospital. 
39.5 
When a full-time or part-time employee attends a mandatory in-service of 8 hours or 
more in place of a scheduled shift of 8 hours or more (and is not given the option of attending the 
in-service on a non-scheduled work day): 
 
53 
39.5.1 
If the in-service does not take place on one of the Hospital’s campuses, the 
Hospital will pay the employee for the straight-time or overtime hours 
missed from the employee’s scheduled shift (not including shift 
differential); 
39.5.2 
If the in-service takes place on one of the Hospital’s campuses, the 
employee may go home and may choose to take PTO to make up for the 
hours missed from the scheduled shift or, 
39.5.3 
If the employee does not wish to go home, the employee may report to the 
staffing office or department head (as applicable) and will be offered work 
for the remainder of the shift or will be paid for the straight-time or 
overtime hours missed from the employee’s scheduled shift (not including 
shift differential); 
39.5.4 
The employee will receive his/her normal shift differential for hours spent 
in attendance at the in-service and any hours actually worked after the in-
service to make up for the hours lost. 
39.6 
Failure to attend a mandatory training program as scheduled will be subject to discipline 
under the Hospital’s attendance policy to the same extent as an absence from scheduled work 
and may result in suspension without pay until completion of the required training.  When a 
mandatory in-service occurs on a full-time employee’s scheduled day off, the employee shall be 
paid at one and one-half (1 ½) his/her straight time hourly rate or granted a different day off.
